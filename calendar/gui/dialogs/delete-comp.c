/**
 * delete_component_dialog:
 * @comp: A calendar component if a single component is to be deleted, or NULL
 * if more that one component is to be deleted.
 * @n_comps: Number of components that are to be deleted.
 * @vtype: Type of the components that are to be deleted.  This is ignored
 * if only one component is to be deleted, and the vtype is extracted from
 * the component instead.
 * @widget: A widget to use as a basis for conversion from UTF8 into font
 * encoding.
 * 
 * Pops up a dialog box asking the user whether he wants to delete a number of
 * calendar components.  The dialog will not appear, however, if the
 * configuration option for confirmation is turned off.
 * 
 * Return value: TRUE if the user clicked Yes, FALSE otherwise.  If the
 * configuration option for confirmation is turned off, this function will
 * unconditionally return TRUE.
