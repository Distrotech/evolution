* gui/alarm-notify/alarm-notify-dialog.c:
	replace missing gnome_win_hints_* calls.
* gui/dialogs/comp-editor-util.c
	there's a comment in comp_editor_create_contacts_component about OAF being broken.
	Check if it's true with BonoboActivation.
* pcs/cal-backend-file.c
	remove usage of BonoboConf
* */*
	remove the G_OBJECT macro in the calls to g_object_ref/_unref, since those functions
