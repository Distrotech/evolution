	** See bug #22542
	
	* component-factory.c (storage_create_folder): If we're creating a
	folder on a vstore, popup a vFolder editor rather than failing.

	** Part of #42691.
	
	* importers/Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): added server_DATA.

	* Makefile.am (%.server.in): create a proper implicit rule for
	temporary .in file.

	** See bug #43974

	* mail-tools.c (mail_tool_do_movemail): use a proper CamelURL to
	decode the uri, not hacky strcmp stuff.

	* mail-account-gui.c (extract_values): if we have an conf_entry,
	ignore username, hostname, and path ones, as these are handled
	implicitly in the url itself.  Came about because of the fix for
	#42838.

	* mail-search.c (mail_search_construct): Put the buttons in HIG
	order; don't replace the label of the stock Find button.  Also,
	add Escape as a keybinding for the Close button (see why GTK+ is
	on crack on b.g.o #74221 and #101293).
