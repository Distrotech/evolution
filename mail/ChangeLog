	* Makefile.am: added -lunicode to evolution_mail_LDADD.

2000-02-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* session.c (session_store_new): Pass a CamelAuthCallback
	(evolution_auth_callback) to camel_session_new.
	
2000-02-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* session.c (session_store_new): Update session_store_new to
	deal with the fact that camel_session_get_store takes a
	CamelException now. Doesn't actually do anything with the
	exception yet, because nothing else does yet either.

2000-02-19  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* .cvsignore: added test-mail.

2000-02-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_load_folder): New routine,
	loads a camel folder.
	(folder_browser_set_uri): redo.

	* session.c: new file.  Implements SessionStores to keep track of
	a Session/Store tuple.  

2000-02-13  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* html-stream.c (html_stream_new): Second param of gtk_html_begin
	should be "", not NULL.
	(html_stream_new): gtk_html_parse() is deprecated, so the call was
	removed.

	* html-stream.h: HTMLStreamClass's parent changed to
	CamelStreamClass, not CamelStream.

2000-02-11  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add the e-text directory to the includes list.

	* message-list.c: Change the call to e_cell_text_new, since
	there's an added argument.

2000-02-09  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added libetext as libetable depends on it.

2000-02-08  Iain Holmes  <ih@csd.abdn.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.am: Changed the order of the compilation so the CORBA stuff
	was made before it was needed.

2000-01-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* Started work on the mail display engine.

	* html-stream.c, html-stream.h: New files, they are CamelStreams
	used to write to the GtkHTML widget.
