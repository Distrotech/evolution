	* message-list.c: Added folder/folder uri to the data stored for
	primary/secondary selection, uses a struct to store the data now.

	from the one where the copy/cut took place.
	(clear_selection): helper to free data inside selection struct.

	drag-data-received callbacks which is Not Good (tm).

	* em-folder-tree.c (tree_drag_data_received): Use
	gtk_tree_view_get_dest_row_at_pos() instead of
	gtk_tree_view_get_path_at_pos() since this is what Nautilus
	uses. Unfortunately, it still gives us back the wrong GtkTreePath
	so it looks to me like Gtk+ is borked. Apparently you need the
	latest and greatest gtk+-2.3.x cvs snapshot for this to work.

	* em-migrate.c (em_migrate_imap_caches_1_4): Copy the imap cache
	into the right place. Duh.

	drafts/sent folder uris to camel uris.

	patch for #48618, use a much simpler method.

	application/octet-stream - any other type (if it doesn't have a
	handler) should just force the user to save to disk.
	(handle_text_plain): Only pay attention to format=flowed if the
	mime-type is text/plain (handle_text_plain is the generic text
	handler, so we might be processing parts that are not really

	those other textual types).

	* mail-callbacks.c (invert_selection): Get rid of the if-focused
	code, that will always prevent the etree from getting the
	selection inverted because the menu item will always have focus at
	this time. Fix for bug #43972.

2003-06-11  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #22542
	
	* component-factory.c (storage_create_folder): If we're creating a
	folder on a vstore, popup a vFolder editor rather than failing.

2003-06-05  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** Part of #42691.
	
	* importers/Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): added server_DATA.

	* Makefile.am (%.server.in): create a proper implicit rule for
	temporary .in file.

	** See bug #43974

	* mail-tools.c (mail_tool_do_movemail): use a proper CamelURL to
	decode the uri, not hacky strcmp stuff.

	* mail-account-gui.c (extract_values): if we have an conf_entry,
	ignore username, hostname, and path ones, as these are handled
	implicitly in the url itself.  Came about because of the fix for
	#42838.

	* mail-search.c (mail_search_construct): Put the buttons in HIG
	order; don't replace the label of the stock Find button.  Also,
	add Escape as a keybinding for the Close button (see why GTK+ is
	on crack on b.g.o #74221 and #101293).
