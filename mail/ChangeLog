2000-06-09  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): close and expunge the source folder
	after copying it to a local folder.

2000-06-09  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* component-factory.c (create_view): Updated to match the changes
	to the definition of `EvolutionShellComponentCreateFn'.  If @type
	is not "mail", return an "unsupported type" error.
	(factory_fn): Pass NULL for the `remove_folder' and
	`create_folder' functions.

2000-06-09  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c: Redo things a bit so that whitespace-only
	text parts aren't displayed. (In particular, so that
	whitespace-only subparts of multipart/mixed aren't displayed as
	separate (empty) parts.)

2000-06-06  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): 
	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_load_folder): Update for folder
	creation/existence changes.

	* message-list.c (message_list_set_folder): Remove the code to
	create the folder if it doesn't exist, since we don't want to do
	that.

2000-06-05  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-ops.c (composer_send_cb): Leave the composer window around
	if the message doesn't get sent.

2000-06-05  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (etable_key): Allow "GDK_KP_Delete", a keypad
	delete key, to delete a message.

2000-06-05  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* session.c (evolution_auth_callback): Remember passwords between
	calls.
	(forget_passwords): Callback for "Forget Passwords" menu item.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): 
	(control_deactivate): Add "Forget Passwords" menu item.

	* mail.h, mail-ops.c: fix some function prototypes

	* mail-format.c (mail_generate_forward): Update for new composer
	attachment interface.

2000-06-02  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@helixcode.com>

	* mail-config.c (providers_config_new): Added a new notebook
	page that allowed for mail format (text/plain or 
	multipart/alternative)

2000-06-02  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c (filter_date): If the date in the summary is 0,
	output "?".

	* component-factory.c (create_view): keep a GList of folder
	browsers created
	(owner_unset_cb): Go through the list and close each folder before
	exiting so they sync their summary state, etc to disk.

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): Use camel_service_connect, not
	connect_with_url, since we already passed the URL into
	camel_session_get_store.

2000-06-02  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Use camel_folder_free_summary instead of
	g_ptr_array_free.  Unref the folder when we're done with it.

2000-06-02  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* session.c: Revert removal of e_setup_base_dir.

2000-06-02  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (my_folder_browser_init): Connect to ETable's
	key_press signal.
	(etable_key): scroll mail on space/backspace.

2000-06-02  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Made sent column as wide as from column.

2000-06-02  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@helixcode.com>

	* mail-config.c (on_cmdSourcesAdd_clicked): Changed identity_row
	to source_row as this is a Sources clist we are dealing with and
	not an identity clist
	(on_cmdSourcesEdit_clicked): same
	(on_cmdSourcesDelete_clicked): again, same
	(on_cmdSourcesEdit_clicked): Source editor now fills in data from
	the clist

2000-06-01  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Add a date column.	
	(COL_SENT_WIDTH_MIN): Make this wider.
	(ml_value_at): return the sent date (as a time_t) for COL_SENT.
	(Fix COL_TO too while I'm here.) 
	(ml_duplicate_value, ml_free_value, ml_initialize_value,
	ml_value_is_empty): COL_SENT is numeric now.
	(message_list_init_renderers): Create a date renderer (using
	text_filter to translate the time_t into a string).
	(message_list_init_header): Use render_date for COL_SENT.

2000-06-01  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* session.c: Don't call e_setup_base_dir.

2000-06-01  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (mail_generate_forward): Fix forwarding to work
	for people other than me. :) [Although apparently it doesn't
	really.]

	* mail-ops.c (delete_msg): Add a quick hack to move the selection
	down a row when you delete a message.

	* mail-format.c (handle_message_rfc822): use <blockquote> rather
	than <center><table border=1 width=95%> to frame the embedded
	message. If <pre> text in the subtable won't fit in the 95% width,
	GtkHTML will write past the border of the table (and
	<blockquote><table border=1> causes creeping updates so it's not
	usable for now).
	
2000-06-01  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c (message_list_init): Turn off the grid in our
	ETable.

2000-06-01  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (write_headers): Oops. This needs to take a
	message argument because we might be writing headers for an
	embedded message/rfc822 subpart rather than the root document.

2000-06-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@helixcode.com>

	* mail-config.c: Config dialogs are completed.
	(service_acceptable): Fixed a segfault caused by duplicate 
	camel_exception_free()
	(providers_config_new): Identity and Source clists are now filled in
	when the dialog is created as well as the Transport page

	* folder-browser-factory.c: Renamed Tool/ menu items
	Vfolder was changed to Virtual Folder and
	Configure Camel Providers was changed to Mail Configuration

2000-06-01  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (evolution_mail_LDADD): Link with
	`libemiscwidgets.a'.

	* mail-display.c (mail_display_new): Use an EScrollFrame instead
	of a GtkScrolledWindow.
	(mail_display_set_message): Likewise.

	* mail-display.h: Replace the GtkScrolledWindow with an
	EScrollFrame.

2000-06-01  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* component-factory.c (owner_unset_cb): Quit when the shell exits.
	This is a kludge, but a pretty necessary one until the refcounting
	bugs that keep the component from exiting properly are fixed.

2000-05-31  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@helixcode.com>

	* mail-config.c: Partially implemented the source
	configuration, seems to segfault due to a destroyed
	gnome dialog being destroyed again in the method
	on_SourceConfigDialogButton_clicked()

2000-05-31  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (free_url, handle_text_enriched,
	get_url_for_icon): Fix up memory management of x-evolution-data
	URLs so the URLs and/or their data don't get freed while there are
	still references to them.

	* message-list.c (message_list_init_header): redo the (unused)
	online status column to no longer refer to pixmaps that no longer
	exist.

2000-06-01  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): Put the toolbar
	into a frame to make it look like standard GNOME toolbars.  Also,
	set `GNOME_DOCK_ITEM_BEH_NEVER_VERTICAL' so that it does not do
	evil things when its moved to the left or the right of the window.

2000-05-31  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@helixcode.com>

	* mail-config.c: Configuration dialog now allows 
	adding/editing/deleting of Identities (which leaves
	adding/editing/deleting of sources left to implement).
	The data is also saved when the dialog is exited via 
	the OK button.

2000-05-31  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (mail_format_mime_message): Initialize the "urls"
	hash table stored on the message and store cid and other URLs
	there rather than as object data on the message.
	(get_cid): rewrite this a bunch
	(handle_text_enriched): move the code from write_iframe_string()
	into here, since it's the only place that actually needs it.
	(handle_text_html): simplify this a lot. We can use a cid: URL
	here rather than x-evolution-data.
	(get_url_for_icon): New routine to return URLs for icons, and
	cache the results, so we don't have to keep re-reading the icon
	files (and so we can't be spoofed into reading non-icon files).
	(handle_mystery, handle_audio): use get_url_for_icon.

	* mail-display.c (save_data): move the CamelMimePart filename
	extracting code from get_cid to here.
	(on_link_clicked, on_object_requested): Update for cid: changes.
	(on_url_requested): Kill off the kludgy, exploitable x-gnome-icon
	URL schema, update cid and x-evolution-data to match
	mail-format.c.

	It should now be easier to implement RFC 2557 (Content-Location,
	etc), but that RFC still pretty much sucks.

2000-05-30  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c: Redo this back to the old way: a single GtkHTML
	with various things inline in it. (Gets rid of flicker, simplifies
	some scrolling, selecting, and printing issues.)
	(handle_text_enriched, handle_text_html): Use <iframe>s for these,
	to protect the rest of the document from their possibily invalid
	HTML.
	(handle_via_bonobo): Use (new-and-improved) <object> tags for
	this, moving most of the work back into mail-display.c

	* mail-display.c (on_object_requested): Move the Bonobo embedding
	code back here again (reorganized a bit).
	(on_url_requested): add x-evolution-data handler, for iframe
	bodies.
	(mail_html_new, mail_html_end): removed
	(mail_display_set_message, mail_display_new): Update for NWO.

2000-05-30  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (search_set): Properly encode the search string.

2000-05-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@helixcode.com>

	* mail.h: Added a prototype for providers_config_new() which
	is the constructor for the configuration dialog window

	* mail-config.c: Added set_service_url() which is basically
	the reverse of get_service_url().
	Implemented on_cmdCamelServicesOK_clicked() - The configuration
	window will now remember the Sendmail/SMTP data that the user
	had entered in the previous session.
	Removed on_cmdCamelServicesApply_clicked() - No need for this.

2000-05-30  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c (message_changed): call
	e_table_model_row_changed, not e_table_model_changed so we do less
	work, and don't lose the current selection.
	(select_msg): Set up a timer to mark the displayed message as
	"seen" if it's selected for longer than 1.5 seconds (a number
	pulled out of Matt's butt).
	(ml_value_at): Use the MESSAGE_STATUS column for read/unread as
	well as deleted.

	* message-list.c: use the "new" tigert pixmaps rather than the
	older ones. Includes a "replied to" icon (which is used now), but
	no "deleted" icon (although we have the strikeout renderer for
	that now).

2000-05-30  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c, message-list.h: Added bold for unread messages.

2000-05-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@helixcode.com>

	* mail.h: Added a prototype for providers_config()
	which is the callback for a new menu item that
	will construct a configuration dialog for the camel
	providers and identities and display it

	* mail-config.c: Added some code to construct the 
	new providers dialog and a bunch of callbacks (most 
	of which are not yet useful)

	* mail-ops.c: Added the code for the providers_confi()
	callback

	* folder-browser-factory.c: Added the 
	"Tools/Camel Providers Configuration ..." menu item

2000-05-30  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Switched to using "cursor_change" signal instead
	of "row_selection" for switching messages.  Select the first row
	(still doesn't work because of ETable.)  Adapt to some small
	ETable changes.  Set drawfocus to FALSE.

2000-05-29  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_load_folder): Hardcode the
	vfolder source to just the inbox (so at least it returns
	something).

	* component-factory.c (create_test_storage): Create a vfolder dir
	first, and put the folders in that.
	(create_test_storage): Create the storage as VFolders, not
	"storage_name" :)

2000-05-28  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-config.c (error_dialog): helper function since we need to
	set "modal" on the dialogs returned by gnome_error_dialog to make
	them work when popped up from the modal Druid.
	(service_acceptable): New function to check if the info entered on
	a store/transport page actually checks out.
	(mail_config_druid): Connect to the "next" signal on the store and
	transport pages and don't let the user continue if the data is
	bad and "check this before continuing" is checked. Also, only
	display sources/transports in the "mail" domain. (Ie, not
	"vfolder".)

	* mail-format.c (write_recipients_to_stream): Use `foo@bar' rather
	than `<foo@bar>' for recipient with no name.

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): don't put up an error message if the
	user cancels the password dialog.

2000-05-27  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* Makefile.am (SHELL_OBJS): Include mail storage so we can
	initialise folders.

	* component-factory.c (create_test_storage): Parses vfolder
	defintions and adds them to the storage.  Definetly needs more
	work.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): Add the VFolder
	druid menu item.
	(control_deactivate): And remove it.

	* mail-ops.c (vfolder_editor_clicked): For editing vfolder
	definitions (rather like filters, oddly enough :).  Tries to
	update the shell but it doesn't seem to work properly - requires a
	mail component restart to take effect.

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_load_folder): Handle vfolder:
	urls' appropriately and map to camel.  Still needs a way to tell
	the vfolder what folders to search! (all vfolders come up empty!).

2000-05-28  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c, message-list.h: Added a COL_DELETED and made it
	the strikeout column for both text renderers.

2000-05-27  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c: Various improvements:

	(call_handler_function, etc): Add a "mime_type" argument to the
	handlers, so that if a part is tagged as
	"application/octet-stream", and we figure out that it's really
	something else, the handler we call can know what that something
	else is.

	(handle_text_enriched): Small fixes to make this not do
	text/enriched-specific syntax in text/richtext or vice versa.

	(handle_mystery): Allow for mystery data that can't even be saved
	to disk. (ie, unrecognized external-body). Let the caller specify
	the URL to use.

	(handle_message_external_body): New function to deal with
	message/external-body parts. Generates URLs for anon-ftp,
	local-file, and URL access-types, and a more-useful-than-before
	descriptive message for other types.

	(handle_audio, handle_undisplayable): Use gnome_mime_get_value to
	try to get a description of the MIME type to display to the user
	rather than the raw form. (This will only work if the user has
	recent gnome-vfs installed. [If they don't, it works just like
	it used to.])

2000-05-26  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (handle_text_html): Fix a bug (security/stability)
	in its usage of mail_html_write.

	* mail-ops.c (composer_send_cb, reply): set CAMEL_MESSAGE_ANSWERED
	on a message after a successful reply.

	* message-list.c (folder_changed): free the summary with
	camel_folder_free_summary rather than g_ptr_array_free.

	* mail-format.c (handle_via_bonobo): Update for PersistStream
	changes

2000-05-25  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* main.c (main): Initialize the component factory.

	* Makefile.am (evolution_mail_LDADD): Link with
	`evolution-shell-component.o' from the shell directory.

	* evolution-mail.oafinfo: Updated with the
	Evolution::ShellComponent OAFIID.

	* evolution-mail.gnorba: Updated with the
	Evolution::ShellComponent GOAD ID.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (folder_browser_factory_new_control):
	New function; code moved out from `folder_browser_factory'.
	(folder_browser_factory): Use it.

	* component-factory.c: New.
	* component-factory.h: New.

2000-05-24  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-ops.c (composer_send_cb): connect to and disconnect from
	the transport.

2000-05-24  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added libepaned.a.

	anymore.

	* folder-browser-factory.c: Don't use crufty service-repository
	anymore.

2000-05-21  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c (get_message_info): Made static.
	(ml_initialize_value): Return NULL to placate compiler.

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_gui_init): Add cast.

	* mail-display.c (mail_html_new): Don't pass an empty URL to
	`gtk_html_begin()' anymore.

	* mail-config.c (put_html): Don't pass an empty URL to
	`gtk_html_begin()' anymore.

	* mail-display.h: Updated for the new GtkHTML API that uses
	`GtkHTMLStream *' instead of `GtkHTMLStreamHandle'.
	* mail-display.c: Likewise.
	* mail-config.c: Likewise.
	* mail-format.c: Likewise.

2000-05-19  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* mail-format.c: Fixes for stream stuff.

	* mail-display.c (save_data_cb): Remove exception stuff on streams.

2000-05-19  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Added initialize_value and value_is_empty
	callbacks.

2000-05-18  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (folder_browser_factory): Remove
	development_warning (moved to shell)

	* message-list.c (select_msg): Update for camel_folder_get_uids
	(folder_changed, message_list_set_folder): Update for
	camel_folder_get_summary

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): Update for camel_folder_get_uids

2000-05-17  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-component.c: This seems to be cruft. Nuke it.

	* mail-display.c (save_data_cb, save_data, on_url_requested):
	* mail-format.c (handle_text_plain_flowed, handle_text_html):
	Use camel_data_wrapper_write_to_stream rather than
	camel_data_wrapper_get_output_stream.

2000-05-16  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* mail-ops.c (filter_edit): Function to bring up the filter editor.
	(filter_druid_clicked): Save/close dialogue.
	(fetch_mail): Apply filters to incoming mail ... *hold breath*
	If we are coming from a non-indexed/searchable/etc source, then
	copy it to an mbox first.  When copying mail from an mbox source,
	dont remove it aftewards, open it for append, so partially
	filtered mail isn't lost.

	* Makefile.am (evolution_mail_LDADD): Added libfilter.
	(INCLUDES): Add EVOLUTION_DATADIR, and fix matt's brokeneditor(tm)
	for putting spaces instead of tabs in.

2000-05-16  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c: Removed usage of bonobo_object_destroy.

2000-05-14  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Updated to work with new ETable resizing.

2000-05-12  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): Use 6 X's to mkstemp, as required by
	the man page, just a temp fix, this should probably change to a
	known filename.

2000-05-11  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): Now that we depend
	on current gnome-libs we can make the toolbar detachable again.

2000-05-11  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (development_warning): Left-justify the
	message.

2000-05-10  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (development_warning): Made this dialog
	have fewer buttons.

2000-05-10  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (development_warning): New development
	warning text from Nat.

2000-05-10  Larry Ewing  <lewing@helixcode.com>

	* mail-config.c (html_new): only set the default background color
	if style is not NULL.

2000-05-09  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am: Removed folder-browser-factory.h since it doesn't
	exist.  Added mail-display.h, mail-types.h, pixmaps.h.

2000-05-09  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): Remove "File->mail"
	menuitem.

	* mail-config.c (mail_config_druid): Fill in "blah blah blah".

2000-05-09  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_load_folder): make this a
	little less kludgy. Use gnome_error_dialog rather than printf on
	errors.

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): Fix to work with the new shell stuff...
	sorta. Will need more fixing later when the new shell framework is
	more done.

	* mail-config.c (finish): Call gnome_config_sync so the data
	actually gets written.

2000-05-08  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c (save_data_cb):
	(on_url_requested): Update for CamelStream CamelException changes.

	* mail-format.c: Pass NULL for a CamelException in a bunch of
	places... the user will see that the data is not being displayed,
	and there's not a lot we can do, and none of these things should
	be failing anyway. Maybe fix this later.

2000-05-07  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* message-list.c (ml_value_at): Size moved to message info, rather
	than content info structure.

2000-05-07  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c (select_msg): unref the message after displaying
	it.

	* mail-format.c (get_data_wrapper_text):
	(handle_text_plain_flowed): 
	(handle_via_bonobo): Replace camel_stream_close calls.

2000-05-07  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c: Changed a toolbar button from saying
	"New mail" (which suggests you might be composing new mail) to
	"Get mail".

2000-05-06  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (folder_browser_factory): Don't
	hardcode "inbox" here.

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_set_uri): Don't hardcode
	"inbox" here either.
	(folder_browser_load_folder): Create a new store according to the
	folder browser's URI, and load the mbox file from that store.
	Parts of this are temporary.

	* session.c, mail.h: There is no longer a global store, just a
	global session.

	* mail-config.c, mail-ops.c: Update for default_session -> session
	change. fetch_mail is currently broken.

	* mail-config.c: New code to configure identity, mail source, and
	mail transport.

	user has configured stuff, and call the	druid if not.
	(fetch_mail, send_msg, send_to_url, reply, forward_msg): Call
	check_configured
	(composer_send_cb): Make this pass the message to a CamelTransport
	rather than just printing it to stdout.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (development_warning): Add a warning
	about sending mail, since you can do that now.

2000-05-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@HelixCode.com>

	* .cvsignore: ignore evolution-mail.pure

	* Makefile.am: add support for building evolution-mail.pure

2000-05-06  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail.h: consolidate mail-format.h, mail-identify.h, mail-ops.h,
	main.h and session.h into this new file. There's no reason to have
	a .h for every .c.

2000-05-05  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* test-mail.c (create_container): Use the OAFIID when using an 
	OAF-enabled build of bonobo.

	summary table, if there is one to free.

	in the LDADD section.

2000-05-03  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (write_recipients_to_stream, write_headers): Make
	the "Cc:" field optional again. (Before, we could check if
	camel_mime_message_get_recipients returned NULL, but now we need
	to actually look into the returned CamelInternetAddress object.)

2000-05-03  Larry Ewing  <lewing@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_gui_init): comment out the
	changed signal for now.

2000-05-02  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	quick-search entry.
	(search_activate): Perform a quick-search on the folder subject
	only.
	(folder_browser_gui_init): Add an option meny to the search line.	
	(create_option_menu): Build the option menu from a table.
	(search_set): Build a search from another string whent he option
	menu or text item is changed.  5 search options are defined so
	far.

	* message-list.c (get_message_info): If there is an active search,
	then get the data from that ... use this instead of
	_get_message_info().
	(ml_row_count): If we have an active search, get the info from its
	result.
	(select_msg): Changed to use get_message_info, so searches work.
	(ml_value_at): And same here.
	(message_list_init_renderers): Added a 3rd state to message_status

	when it cahgnes.
	(message_list_set_search): Save the search string.
	(folder_changed): If the folder changes, re-run the search,
	otherwise we may end up with invalid entries in the display.

	* mail-display.c: Include missing errno.h.

2000-04-30  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* session.c (session_providers_init): This is no longer necessary.

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): Remove kludge to load remote provider,
	as camel can do it by itself now.

2000-04-29  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c (on_link_clicked): Handle clicks on "cid" URLs by
	popping up a "Save Attachment" dialog.

	* mail-format.c (get_cid): if the part has a Content-Disposition
	with a filename specified, record (a sanitized version of) that on
	the wrapper when creating the cid reference, so the "save
	attachment" code can use it later.
	(handle_mystery): fix a bug in the cid generation here.

2000-04-29  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (lookup_handler, etc): Improve the builtin vs

	bonobo control fails.

	* mail-identify.c (mail_identify_mime_part): New function to
	attempt to identify a MIME part that we can't identify based on
	Content-Type alone.

	* mail-display.c (on_url_requested): redo the mystery data icon
	display stuff less kludgily.

2000-04-28  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (write_recipients_to_stream, write_headers,
	mail_generate_reply): Update (minimally) for Camel recipient
	changes.

2000-04-28  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* main.c (init_bonobo): Don't call `init_corba()' and don't get
	any args.
	(init_corba) [!USING_OAF]: Fix args.

2000-04-27  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c: New macro `CONTROL_FACTORY_ID', which
	is #defined to a different value according to whether we are
	`USING_OAF' or not.
	(folder_browser_factory_init): Use `CONTROL_FACTORY_ID'.

	* test-mail.c
	(init_corba): New helper function, implemented differently
	according to `USING_OAF'.
	(main): Use `init_corba()'.

	* main.c
	(init_corba): New helper function, implemented differently
	according to `USING_OAF'.
	(init_bonobo): Use `init_corba()'.

	* Makefile.am: Install OAF stuff if `USING_OAF'.  Add
	`-I$(datadir)/idl' to the `orbit-idl' command-line so that we can
	use Bonobo IDL files installed under our prefix as well.  Also,
	use `$(ORBIT_IDL)' instead of hardcoded `orbit-idl'.

	* evolution-mail.oafinfo: New file.

2000-04-27  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c: Move text_to_html to e-util.

	* mail-ops.c (send_to_url): New routine. Thin wrapper for
	e_msg_composer_new_from_url.

	* mail-display.c (on_link_clicked): print a warning for news or
	nntp URLs (which we'll deal with some day), and call send_to_url
	for mailto URLs.

	* mail-format.c (text_to_html): Improve URL conversion code.
	Recognize https, recognize "www\..*" without a prefixed "http://".
	Properly escape &, <, >, etc in URL strings. Don't be fooled by
	"mailto:", "http://", etc with no following data.

2000-04-26  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (text_to_html): Reorganize a bit and add a new
	flag, TEXT_TO_HTML_CONVERT_URLS to recognize and wrap URLs
	in text.

	* mail-display.c (mail_html_new): Add link_clicked signal handler.
	(on_link_clicked): Use gnome_url_show to launch a browser.

	* mail-format.c: update for CamelStream changes. Update for
	CamelMimeBodyPart -> CamelMimePart

2000-04-25  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c, mail-format.c: Redo large chunks of this. The
	mail display now consists of a vbox in a scrolled window, in which
	we put multiple GtkHTML objects. This means broken HTML in one
	part can't corrupt other parts. The headers now scroll with the
	body. Unrecognized attachments look prettier, but still don't do
	anything, and will probably be changed later. We can also now
	display nested message/rfc822 parts and multipart/alternatives
	with multipart subparts. Oh, and text/{richtext,enriched}, since
	we had all these ancient sample messages that use it and the lack
	of support annoyed me. :)

	Bonobo embeddables are broken right now, but I don't think that's
	my fault.

	* mail-format.c (reply_body): Fix some bugs that crept into reply
	generation. This needs a lot more work to deal correctly with
	complicated bodies.
	(setup_function_table): pass unknown text subtypes to
	handle_text_plain.
	(handle_multipart_appledouble): new handler. Just ignores the
	first (application/applefile) part and tries to display the
	second part. Since the second part is usually
	application/octet-stream, this doesn't work very well still
	usually.
	(reply_body): Make this deal better with multiparts.

	* mail-format.c, mail-display.c: Now that we're not limited to
	a single GtkHTML for the display, there's no reason to embed
	Bonobo objects for unrecognized content-types in GtkHTML rather
	than embedded them into the vbox directly. So do that.

	Meanwhile, fix up the handler-selection code so that we can
	declare which built-in handlers are more desirable than external
	handlers and which are less. (Of course, eventually we'll want
	this to be customizable.) Add some cleverness to
	handle_multipart_alternative as well so it doesn't accept an
	alternative which we can display generically over one we can
	display specifically.

	* mail-format.c (text_to_html): add a convert_space_hack flag,
	which turns N spaces into N-1 &nbsp;s and a space.
	(handle_text_plain): Check for "format=flowed" in the
	Content-Type.
	(handle_text_plain_flowed): Spinoff of handle_text_plain to deal
	with RFC 2646 flowed text. (All the examples I can find of it
	are generated by Eudora, but it's a pretty cool idea that ought
	to be used more widely.)

2000-04-23  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c: rename "send" to "send_msg", to avoid
	name clash with the tcp function. Connect the "forward" button.

	* mail-ops.c: rename "send" to "send_msg", to avoid name clash
	with the tcp function. Add forward_msg function.

	* mail-format.c (mail_generate_forward): support function for
	forward_msg. Pretty much a big kludge right now, pending the
	attachment/attachment-bar changes.

2000-04-22  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c (on_url_requested): Change cid expectations to
	match current camel reality.

	* main.c (main): call glade_gnome_init, for composer.

	* folder-browser-factory.c: move msg_composer_cb and
	msg_composer_send_cb to mail-ops. Attach send, reply, and "reply
	to all" buttons.

	* mail-ops.c (composer_send_cb, send): moved from
	folder-browser-factory.c.
	(reply_to_sender, reply_to_all): new functions to do replies.

	* mail-format.c (text_to_html): Add an "add_pre" flag, to make
	it wrap the output in <pre></pre>.
	(mail_generate_reply): New function to create a composer and build
	a reply in it.

2000-04-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c (on_url_requested): deal with cid: URLs.
	(find_cid): helper routine for above. (This could be much better.)
	(mail_display_init): connect url_requested signal

	* mail-format.c (handle_multipart_related): Make this work.

	* mail-display.c (mail_display_set_message): ref the message we
	display, since we're going to unref it when we remove it. Fixes a
	bug that showed up with the new camel code, but it's not obvious
	if it's due to a bug or a feature in the new code.

2000-04-20  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* Makefile.am (evolution_mail_LDADD): Add libibex.la to link.

	* message-list.h: Removed folder summary.

	* message-list.c: Dont include folder-summary anymore.
	(select_msg): Changed to use folder, not summary in
	summary_get_message_info().  God this code is grotty.
	(ml_value_at): Ditto.
	(ml_value_at): Changed to use new interface.  Hmm, this returns a
	static variable, that seems wrong.
	(message_list_set_folder): Remove folder summary.
	(ml_row_count): Oops, remove some debug i put there.

2000-04-20  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c: update for bonobo change, and remove a
	now-unused variable.

2000-04-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c (on_row_selection_idle): new function, actually
	calls select_msg.
	(on_row_selection_cmd): register an idle instead of calling
	select_msg directly.  this fixes the lag before the row is
	selected - selection is instantaneous now, with message loading
	happening afterward.

	* message-list.h: add row_to_select and an idle_id to the message
	list to make the select_msg call happen in an idle func.

	* message-list.c (message_list_init_renderers): no more
	e_cell_set_editable.  this info always comes from the model.

2000-04-14  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.[ch]: Moved from camel/camel-formatter, and changed
	slightly. (More to come.)

	* html-stream.[ch]: No longer necessary. mail-format uses
	GtkHTMLStreamHandles directly.

	* mail-display.[ch]: update for new message formatting code.

2000-04-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): use
	gnome_app_fill_toolbar_with_data, so we get the beautiful gnome
	toolbar.

2000-04-14  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (development_warning): Fix up the
	warning message a bit.
	(folder_browser_factory): Make the warning bypassable.

2000-04-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* main.c (main): Call e_cursors_init.

2000-04-10  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): use camel_movemail when fetching mail
	from an mbox store. This leaves behind temp files for now,
	because CamelMboxFolder::delete is too confused to use, and NotZed
	is rewriting CamelMboxFolder, so I'm not going to bother to try to
	fix it.

	* mail-ops.c: Add some #includes for the non-HAVE_MKSTEMP case

2000-04-09  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_new): set folder_browser->uri
	to NULL, so that we know when to free it.

2000-04-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* message-list.c (states_pixmaps): Add more beautiful art from
	Miggue, the Diego Rivera of the next millenium.
	(message_list_init_header): Use the beautiful art.

	* pixmaps: Miguel rediscovers the "transparent" concept.

2000-04-07  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_destroy): Unref the shell
	interface that we have a handle to.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_destroy_cb): New function;
	destroys a folder-browser when its control is destroyed.
	(folder_browser_factory): Hook up to the above.

2000-04-07  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-ops.c: new file, for toolbar/menu callbacks
	(fetch_mail): fetch mail. Doesn't do mbox locking. Many kludges.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): use new fetch_mail
	function as the callback for the "New mail" icon. Rename check_cb
	to random_cb.

	* Makefile.am: don't build test-sources since the version in
	CVS doesn't do much and once I've fixed it it won't be a separate
	program. Add mail-ops.[ch].

2000-04-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* message-list.c: Stick pixmaps here.

	* mail-display.c (embeddable_destroy_cb): Replaced C++ comments
	with C comments.

	* message-list.c (load_internal_images): New function, loads images.
	(message_list_init_renderers): Load images, fix previous attempt
	at loading images. 

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Added distribution of pixmaps.

	* pixmaps: New directory, used to hold the XPMs we ship with. 

	* pixmaps/envelope-closed.xpm, pixmaps/envelope-open.xpm: Tigert's
	envelopes incorporated.

2000-03-31  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* message-list.c (ml_value_at): Fix miss-used variable. 

2000-04-01  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_properties_init): update to
	new property  (folder_browser_property_changed): kill.
	(get_prop, set_prop): do the donkey work + make properly RW.

2000-03-31  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (folder_browser_set_shell):
	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_new):
	* message-list.c (on_row_selection_cmd, select_msg,
	message_list_init, message_list_set_folder):

	remove debugging printf()s that no longer seem useful

2000-03-29  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): build a toolbar.
	(control_deactivate): and hide it.

2000-03-27  Chris Toshok <toshok@helixcode.com>
	* mail-display.c: quiet warnings when building in ../po

2000-03-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	fix. 

2000-03-25  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

2000-03-14  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-sources.c: First cut at a mail source selection wizard.
	Basically a rigged demo at this point. Doesn't use camel to get
	its information, and is not yet complete or integrated with the
	mail component. Did I mention that the code is ugly?

2000-03-13  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (folder_browser_set_shell): 
	for testing and demonstration purpose, immediately 
	register a fake service.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (development_warning): 
	added a warning so that the user knows that this 
	version may crash his mails.

2000-03-05  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.h: include a referrence to the parent 
	folder browser.

	* message-list.c (ml_value_at): use the message summary 
	from the 

	* html-stream.c (html_stream_close): when the stream 
	is closed, set the html stream to NULL
	(html_stream_write): don't write anything if the 
	html handle does not exist. 
	(html_stream_reset): implemented. close the current 
	html handle and begins a new html parser.

	here. 

2000-03-05  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Added a prototype message listing.

2000-03-04  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	correctly.
	
2000-03-04  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Use g_int_compare and g_str_compare as we should
	be instead of g_int_equal and g_str_equal.
	
2000-03-04  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* test-mail.c (main): replace the bonobo-active/gtk-main
	by bonobo-main.
	Include Gnorba headers.
	(main): don't call the container creation routine 
	before we entered the main loop. Use idle for that.

2000-03-04  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Change this to use the ETable widget itself
	instead of building it from all the parts.

2000-03-03  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Ref the table columns since we unref them at the
	end.

2000-03-01  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add `$(top_srcdir)'.  Also, the
	`top_srcdir' includes must come first everything else to avoid
	including installed headers instead of our fresh ones.

2000-02-28  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* Makefile.am (evolution_mail_LDADD): Fixed references to eutil.

2000-02-24  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	arguments to e-table-item.

2000-02-23  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	of exceptions.

2000-02-22  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* message-list.c (message_list_set_folder): 
	fix to show a sample correct implementation. 

2000-02-21  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

2000-02-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* session.c (session_store_new): Pass a CamelAuthCallback
	(evolution_auth_callback) to camel_session_new.
	
2000-02-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* session.c (session_store_new): Update session_store_new to
	deal with the fact that camel_session_get_store takes a
	CamelException now. Doesn't actually do anything with the
	exception yet, because nothing else does yet either.

2000-02-19  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* .cvsignore: added test-mail.

2000-02-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_load_folder): New routine,
	loads a camel folder.
	(folder_browser_set_uri): redo.

	* session.c: new file.  Implements SessionStores to keep track of
	a Session/Store tuple.  

2000-02-13  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* html-stream.c (html_stream_new): Second param of gtk_html_begin
	should be "", not NULL.
	(html_stream_new): gtk_html_parse() is deprecated, so the call was
	removed.

	* html-stream.h: HTMLStreamClass's parent changed to
	CamelStreamClass, not CamelStream.

2000-02-11  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add the e-text directory to the includes list.

	* message-list.c: Change the call to e_cell_text_new, since
	there's an added argument.

2000-02-09  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added libetext as libetable depends on it.

2000-02-08  Iain Holmes  <ih@csd.abdn.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.am: Changed the order of the compilation so the CORBA stuff
	was made before it was needed.

2000-01-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* Started work on the mail display engine.

	* html-stream.c, html-stream.h: New files, they are CamelStreams
	used to write to the GtkHTML widget.
