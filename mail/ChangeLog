	* em-utils.c (em_utils_add_address): rfc2047 decode the address
	here before passing it off to the addressbook (which expects it to

	text too.

	* em-format.c (emf_message_deliverystatus): format delivery

	function for em_folder_tree_model_expand_foreach().

	source content displayed.
	(em_format_format_secure): make this a function.  and if we're
	done formatting a secure part, and we dont have a parent anymore,
	null out the validity.  See #55541.

2004-03-12  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* em-folder-browser.c (emfb_search_search_activated): No-op if
	emfv->folder is NULL (this means we are looking at a store folder?

	been since before 1.2).
	(send_queue_send): Before enetring the main send loop, create a
	temporary uid array containing ONLY the messages we will send
	(ie. not any that have been marked deleted) so that we can more
	accurately report the number of messages total that we are
	sending. Also continue sending even if we encounter an exeption in
	mail_send_message() (unless, of course, it is a
	user-cancel). Merge any exceptions we get into the master
	exception variable and ALWAYS sync/expunge the queue folder.

	X-Evolution-Mailer header.

2004-03-11  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* em-folder-browser.c (emfb_set_folder): a really gross hack,

	fix for #55267, and ugly as it is.
	(emfb_init): save the search signal id's.
	(emfb_set_folder): ugh, properly set the defaults if the settings
	haven't been stored on the folder, and properly move them upstream
	to the bonobo menus.

	* em-folder-tree-model.c (sort_cb): when we sort, handle not
	having the node in the tree.  otherwise we always compare against
	"" which puts it at the head of the branch, rather than the tail.

	joe.  #55246.

	* em-folder-selector.c (em_folder_selector_construct): dont set
	this to be modal.  otherwise you can't click on error popups. duh.

	argument (header value). For address/date headers, if this isn't
	set, default back to the old behaviour of looking it up.
	(efh_format_headers): If we are iterating thru the camel raw
	headers, always pas the header value as the txt argument,
	otherwise always pass NULL.

	place).

	* em-folder-tree-model.c (folder_subscribed): Emit a new

	* em-folder-tree.c (emft_create_folder): New async function to
	create a folder.

	* em-folder-tree-model.c (em_folder_tree_model_set_folder_info):
	if we have the folder opened already, and its the outbox, then use

	arrows in these widgets as GTK_SHADOW_NONE, since the default arrow

	Fix for bug #54057

	* em-utils.c (em_utils_folder_is_sent): Use provider->url_equal()
	rather than camel_store_uri_cmp() since that function did not do
	anything close to what it claimed to do. Also use
	em_uri_to_camel() here on the account sent_folder_uri.
	(em_utils_folder_is_drafts): Same.

2004-02-23  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* em-composer-prefs.c (sig_fill_list): Changed the name to not

	that em-popup.c can disable the delete flag for these.

	* em-popup.c (em_popup_target_new_folder): Instead of taking an
	isstore argument, take a flags argument so that our caller can
	give us hints about the selected folder/store. Also fixed a logic

	* em-popup.c (em_popup_target_new_folder): Check for vTrash/vJunk

	good name). Also changed to check flags & CAMEL_FOLDER_NOSELECT
	rather than checking the uri string for a noselect param.

	* mail-folder-cache.c (unset_folder_info): Instead of checking for
	";noselect" in the uri, check for a CAMEL_FOLDER_NOSELECT flag on
	mfi->flags.

	Fix for bug #54060 (except for the "don't let users copy/move
	messages to Outbox" bit).

	* em-folder-tree.c (emft_drop_target): Rearranged a little. We can

	the default local folders (Drafts/Inbox/Outbox/Sent) since we
	don't want to be able to move them anywhere else (copying is ok).
	(emft_popup_copy_folder_selected): Don't allow moving any of the

	* importers/netscape-importer.c: use mail-importer to import the

	required.

	* mail-ops.c (mail_mark_junk): ugh, this stuff totally can't go
	accessing messagelist from another thread!!!!  Changed so this
	code only does the junk reporting, not setting flags.  UGH!  It
	should be doing this implictly on the folder when you set the
	flags, or at least when you sync the folder!!!  Changed ot use the
	queued thread.

	* message-list.c (find_next_undeleted): changed to find
	next-unhidden, i.e. junk as well as deleted, if we're in

	* em-folder-tree-model.c

	type in a stack if we had any.

2004-01-29  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #53320 and probably others

	* message-list.c (message_list_set_folder): NULL out
	message_list->folder when we clear it so it isn't left for another

	** See bug #52190.

	* message-list.c: Added folder/folder uri to the data stored for
	primary/secondary selection, uses a struct to store the data now.

	from the one where the copy/cut took place.
	(clear_selection): helper to free data inside selection struct.

2004-01-29  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #53506.

	* em-folder-tree.c (tree_drag_drop): Don't call
	gtk_drag_get_data() manually here or we end up getting 2
	drag-data-received callbacks which is Not Good (tm).

	* em-folder-tree-model.c (drop_folder): Now takes a moved argument
	to specify whether or not the contents were moved (the move
	argument is just a hint).
	(drop_uid_list): Same.
	(em_folder_tree_model_drag_data_received): Updated for the above
	api changes.

2004-01-28  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* em-folder-tree.c (tree_drag_data_received): Use
	gtk_tree_view_get_dest_row_at_pos() instead of
	gtk_tree_view_get_path_at_pos() since this is what Nautilus
	uses. Unfortunately, it still gives us back the wrong GtkTreePath
	so it looks to me like Gtk+ is borked. Apparently you need the
	latest and greatest gtk+-2.3.x cvs snapshot for this to work.

	* em-migrate.c (em_migrate_imap_caches_1_4): Copy the imap cache
	into the right place. Duh.

	url encoding too.  make run-once and thread-safe.

	(em_folder_tree_model_row_drop_target): Again.

	(em_folder_tree_model_drag_data_delete): Same.

	'want_plain', because that arg is for whether or not the body
	should be quoted.

	* folder-browser.c (message_list_drag_data_get): Apply a
	From-filter when dragging as a test/uri-list and
	message/rfc822. Fixes bug #45617. Also free the uids ptrarray for

	id.
	(message_browser_destroy): Disconnect the signal handlers by id.

2003-06-18  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* message-list.c (hide_save_state): Only save state if we have a

	for a parent message status if it has unread children but has been
	read itself. Instead, show that we have unread children by just

2003-06-11  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* mail-format.c (format_mime_part): We only really want to use
	mail_identify_mime_part() if the content-type is
	application/octet-stream - any other type (if it doesn't have a
	handler) should just force the user to save to disk.
	(handle_text_plain): Only pay attention to format=flowed if the
	mime-type is text/plain (handle_text_plain is the generic text
	handler, so we might be processing parts that are not really
	text/plain, thus the format param may have different meaning for
	those other textual types).

2003-06-11  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

	* mail-format.c (mail_lookup_handler): free the application list
	if we are bailing.

	** See bug #22542
	
	* component-factory.c (storage_create_folder): If we're creating a
	folder on a vstore, popup a vFolder editor rather than failing.

	** Part of #42691.
	
	* importers/Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): added server_DATA.

	decode the uri, not hacky strcmp stuff.

	* mail-account-gui.c (extract_values): if we have an conf_entry,
	ignore username, hostname, and path ones, as these are handled

2003-06-03  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@ximian.com>

	* mail-search.c (mail_search_construct): Put the buttons in HIG
