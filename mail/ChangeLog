	if style is not NULL.

2000-05-09  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

2000-05-09  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_load_folder): make this a
	little less kludgy. Use gnome_error_dialog rather than printf on
	errors.

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): Fix to work with the new shell stuff...
	sorta. Will need more fixing later when the new shell framework is
	more done.

	* mail-config.c (finish): Call gnome_config_sync so the data
	actually gets written.

2000-05-08  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c (save_data_cb):
	(on_url_requested): Update for CamelStream CamelException changes.

	* mail-format.c: Pass NULL for a CamelException in a bunch of
	places... the user will see that the data is not being displayed,
	and there's not a lot we can do, and none of these things should
	be failing anyway. Maybe fix this later.

2000-05-07  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* message-list.c (ml_value_at): Size moved to message info, rather
	than content info structure.

	* folder-browser-factory.c: Changed a toolbar button from saying
	"New mail" (which suggests you might be composing new mail) to
	"Get mail".

2000-05-06  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (folder_browser_factory): Don't
	hardcode "inbox" here.

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_set_uri): Don't hardcode
	"inbox" here either.
	(folder_browser_load_folder): Create a new store according to the
	folder browser's URI, and load the mbox file from that store.

	* session.c, mail.h: There is no longer a global store, just a
	global session.

	* mail-config.c, mail-ops.c: Update for default_session -> session
	change. fetch_mail is currently broken.

2000-05-06  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-config.c: New code to configure identity, mail source, and
	mail transport.
	(mail_config_druid): A druid using the config widgets. (Only
	allows configuration of a single identity, source, and transport.)

	* mail-ops.c (check_configured): New function to make sure the
	user has configured stuff, and call the	druid if not.
	(fetch_mail, send_msg, send_to_url, reply, forward_msg): Call
	check_configured
	(composer_send_cb): Make this pass the message to a CamelTransport
	rather than just printing it to stdout.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (development_warning): Add a warning
	about sending mail, since you can do that now.

2000-05-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@HelixCode.com>

	* .cvsignore: ignore evolution-mail.pure

	* Makefile.am: add support for building evolution-mail.pure

2000-05-06  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail.h: consolidate mail-format.h, mail-identify.h, mail-ops.h,
	main.h and session.h into this new file. There's no reason to have
	a .h for every .c.

2000-05-05  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* test-mail.c (create_container): Use the OAFIID when using an 
	OAF-enabled build of bonobo.

2000-05-04  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* message-list.c (message_list_set_folder): Get the whole message
	summary right away.
	(folder_changed): And if we change too.
	(ml_row_count): Use the match count or summary table length as the
	row count.

	(message_list_destroy): Free the summary search cache and the
	summary table, if there is one to free.

	summary search cache for reuse.
	(folder_changed): Re-retrieve the summary list if the folder has
	changed.
	(message_list_set_folder): Retrieve the summary list when opening
	the folder.

2000-05-03  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* Makefile.am (evolution_mail_LDADD): s/-lunicode/$(UNICODE_LIBS)/
	in the LDADD section.

2000-05-03  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (write_recipients_to_stream, write_headers): Make
	the "Cc:" field optional again. (Before, we could check if
	camel_mime_message_get_recipients returned NULL, but now we need
	to actually look into the returned CamelInternetAddress object.)

2000-05-03  Larry Ewing  <lewing@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_gui_init): comment out the
	changed signal for now.

2000-05-02  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	only.
	(folder_browser_gui_init): Add an option meny to the search line.	
	(create_option_menu): Build the option menu from a table.
	(search_set): Build a search from another string whent he option
	menu or text item is changed.  5 search options are defined so
	far.

	* message-list.c (get_message_info): If there is an active search,
	then get the data from that ... use this instead of
	_get_message_info().
	(ml_row_count): If we have an active search, get the info from its
	result.
	(select_msg): Changed to use get_message_info, so searches work.
	(ml_value_at): And same here.
	(message_list_init_renderers): Added a 3rd state to message_status

	when it cahgnes.
	(message_list_set_search): Save the search string.
	(folder_changed): If the folder changes, re-run the search,
	otherwise we may end up with invalid entries in the display.

	* mail-display.c: Include missing errno.h.

2000-04-30  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* session.c (session_providers_init): This is no longer necessary.

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): Remove kludge to load remote provider,
	as camel can do it by itself now.

2000-04-29  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c (on_link_clicked): Handle clicks on "cid" URLs by
	popping up a "Save Attachment" dialog.

	* mail-format.c (get_cid): if the part has a Content-Disposition
	with a filename specified, record (a sanitized version of) that on
	the wrapper when creating the cid reference, so the "save
	attachment" code can use it later.
	(handle_mystery): fix a bug in the cid generation here.

2000-04-29  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (lookup_handler, etc): Improve the builtin vs
	bonobo selection code.

	"mystery data" info, when available
	(handle_unknown_type): Call mail_identify_mime_part before

	that handle_unknown_type can try alternate viewers.
	(handle_via_bonobo): Fall back to handle_undisplayable if the
	bonobo control fails.

	* mail-identify.c (mail_identify_mime_part): New function to
	attempt to identify a MIME part that we can't identify based on
	Content-Type alone.

	* mail-display.c (on_url_requested): redo the mystery data icon
	display stuff less kludgily.

2000-04-28  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (write_recipients_to_stream, write_headers,
	mail_generate_reply): Update (minimally) for Camel recipient
	changes.

2000-04-28  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* main.c (init_bonobo): Don't call `init_corba()' and don't get
	any args.
	(init_corba) [!USING_OAF]: Fix args.

2000-04-27  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c: New macro `CONTROL_FACTORY_ID', which
	is #defined to a different value according to whether we are
	`USING_OAF' or not.
	(folder_browser_factory_init): Use `CONTROL_FACTORY_ID'.

	* test-mail.c
	(init_corba): New helper function, implemented differently
	according to `USING_OAF'.
	(main): Use `init_corba()'.

	* main.c
	(init_corba): New helper function, implemented differently
	according to `USING_OAF'.
	(init_bonobo): Use `init_corba()'.

	* Makefile.am: Install OAF stuff if `USING_OAF'.  Add
	`-I$(datadir)/idl' to the `orbit-idl' command-line so that we can
	use Bonobo IDL files installed under our prefix as well.  Also,
	use `$(ORBIT_IDL)' instead of hardcoded `orbit-idl'.

	* evolution-mail.oafinfo: New file.

2000-04-27  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c: Move text_to_html to e-util.

	* mail-ops.c (send_to_url): New routine. Thin wrapper for
	e_msg_composer_new_from_url.

	* mail-display.c (on_link_clicked): print a warning for news or
	nntp URLs (which we'll deal with some day), and call send_to_url
	for mailto URLs.

	* mail-format.c (text_to_html): Improve URL conversion code.
	Recognize https, recognize "www\..*" without a prefixed "http://".
	Properly escape &, <, >, etc in URL strings. Don't be fooled by
	"mailto:", "http://", etc with no following data.

2000-04-26  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.c (text_to_html): Reorganize a bit and add a new
	flag, TEXT_TO_HTML_CONVERT_URLS to recognize and wrap URLs
	in text.

	* mail-display.c (mail_html_new): Add link_clicked signal handler.
	(on_link_clicked): Use gnome_url_show to launch a browser.

	* mail-format.c: update for CamelStream changes. Update for
	CamelMimeBodyPart -> CamelMimePart

2000-04-25  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c, mail-format.c: Redo large chunks of this. The
	mail display now consists of a vbox in a scrolled window, in which
	we put multiple GtkHTML objects. This means broken HTML in one
	part can't corrupt other parts. The headers now scroll with the
	body. Unrecognized attachments look prettier, but still don't do
	anything, and will probably be changed later. We can also now
	display nested message/rfc822 parts and multipart/alternatives
	with multipart subparts. Oh, and text/{richtext,enriched}, since
	we had all these ancient sample messages that use it and the lack
	of support annoyed me. :)

	Bonobo embeddables are broken right now, but I don't think that's
	my fault.

	* mail-format.c (reply_body): Fix some bugs that crept into reply
	generation. This needs a lot more work to deal correctly with
	complicated bodies.
	(setup_function_table): pass unknown text subtypes to
	handle_text_plain.
	(handle_multipart_appledouble): new handler. Just ignores the
	first (application/applefile) part and tries to display the
	second part. Since the second part is usually
	application/octet-stream, this doesn't work very well still
	usually.
	(reply_body): Make this deal better with multiparts.

	* mail-format.c, mail-display.c: Now that we're not limited to
	a single GtkHTML for the display, there's no reason to embed
	Bonobo objects for unrecognized content-types in GtkHTML rather
	than embedded them into the vbox directly. So do that.

	Meanwhile, fix up the handler-selection code so that we can
	declare which built-in handlers are more desirable than external
	handlers and which are less. (Of course, eventually we'll want
	this to be customizable.) Add some cleverness to
	handle_multipart_alternative as well so it doesn't accept an
	alternative which we can display generically over one we can
	display specifically.

	* mail-format.c (text_to_html): add a convert_space_hack flag,
	which turns N spaces into N-1 &nbsp;s and a space.
	(handle_text_plain): Check for "format=flowed" in the
	Content-Type.
	(handle_text_plain_flowed): Spinoff of handle_text_plain to deal
	with RFC 2646 flowed text. (All the examples I can find of it
	are generated by Eudora, but it's a pretty cool idea that ought
	to be used more widely.)

2000-04-23  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c: rename "send" to "send_msg", to avoid
	name clash with the tcp function. Connect the "forward" button.

	* mail-ops.c: rename "send" to "send_msg", to avoid name clash
	with the tcp function. Add forward_msg function.

	* mail-format.c (mail_generate_forward): support function for
	forward_msg. Pretty much a big kludge right now, pending the
	attachment/attachment-bar changes.

2000-04-22  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c (on_url_requested): Change cid expectations to
	match current camel reality.

	* main.c (main): call glade_gnome_init, for composer.

	* folder-browser-factory.c: move msg_composer_cb and
	msg_composer_send_cb to mail-ops. Attach send, reply, and "reply
	to all" buttons.

	* mail-ops.c (composer_send_cb, send): moved from
	folder-browser-factory.c.
	(reply_to_sender, reply_to_all): new functions to do replies.

	* mail-format.c (text_to_html): Add an "add_pre" flag, to make
	it wrap the output in <pre></pre>.
	(mail_generate_reply): New function to create a composer and build
	a reply in it.

2000-04-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c (on_url_requested): deal with cid: URLs.
	(find_cid): helper routine for above. (This could be much better.)
	(mail_display_init): connect url_requested signal

	* mail-format.c (handle_multipart_related): Make this work.

	* mail-display.c (mail_display_set_message): ref the message we
	display, since we're going to unref it when we remove it. Fixes a
	bug that showed up with the new camel code, but it's not obvious
	if it's due to a bug or a feature in the new code.

2000-04-20  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* Makefile.am (evolution_mail_LDADD): Add libibex.la to link.

	* message-list.h: Removed folder summary.

	* message-list.c: Dont include folder-summary anymore.
	(select_msg): Changed to use folder, not summary in
	summary_get_message_info().  God this code is grotty.
	(ml_value_at): Ditto.
	(ml_value_at): Changed to use new interface.  Hmm, this returns a
	static variable, that seems wrong.
	(message_list_set_folder): Remove folder summary.
	(ml_row_count): Oops, remove some debug i put there.

2000-04-20  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-display.c: update for bonobo change, and remove a
	now-unused variable.

2000-04-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c (on_row_selection_idle): new function, actually
	calls select_msg.
	(on_row_selection_cmd): register an idle instead of calling
	select_msg directly.  this fixes the lag before the row is
	selected - selection is instantaneous now, with message loading
	happening afterward.

	* message-list.h: add row_to_select and an idle_id to the message
	list to make the select_msg call happen in an idle func.

	* message-list.c (message_list_init_renderers): no more
	e_cell_set_editable.  this info always comes from the model.

2000-04-14  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-format.[ch]: Moved from camel/camel-formatter, and changed
	slightly. (More to come.)

	* html-stream.[ch]: No longer necessary. mail-format uses
	GtkHTMLStreamHandles directly.

	* mail-display.[ch]: update for new message formatting code.

2000-04-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): use
	gnome_app_fill_toolbar_with_data, so we get the beautiful gnome
	toolbar.

2000-04-14  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (development_warning): Fix up the
	warning message a bit.
	(folder_browser_factory): Make the warning bypassable.

2000-04-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* main.c (main): Call e_cursors_init.

2000-04-10  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-ops.c (fetch_mail): use camel_movemail when fetching mail
	from an mbox store. This leaves behind temp files for now,
	because CamelMboxFolder::delete is too confused to use, and NotZed
	is rewriting CamelMboxFolder, so I'm not going to bother to try to
	fix it.

	* mail-ops.c: Add some #includes for the non-HAVE_MKSTEMP case

2000-04-09  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_new): set folder_browser->uri
	to NULL, so that we know when to free it.

2000-04-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* message-list.c (states_pixmaps): Add more beautiful art from
	Miggue, the Diego Rivera of the next millenium.
	(message_list_init_header): Use the beautiful art.

	* pixmaps: Miguel rediscovers the "transparent" concept.

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_destroy): Unref the shell
	interface that we have a handle to.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_destroy_cb): New function;
	destroys a folder-browser when its control is destroyed.
	(folder_browser_factory): Hook up to the above.

2000-04-07  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-ops.c: new file, for toolbar/menu callbacks
	(fetch_mail): fetch mail. Doesn't do mbox locking. Many kludges.

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): use new fetch_mail
	function as the callback for the "New mail" icon. Rename check_cb
	to random_cb.

	* Makefile.am: don't build test-sources since the version in
	CVS doesn't do much and once I've fixed it it won't be a separate
	program. Add mail-ops.[ch].

2000-04-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* message-list.c: Stick pixmaps here.

	* mail-display.c (embeddable_destroy_cb): Replaced C++ comments
	with C comments.

	* message-list.c (load_internal_images): New function, loads images.
	(message_list_init_renderers): Load images, fix previous attempt
	at loading images. 

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Added distribution of pixmaps.

	* pixmaps: New directory, used to hold the XPMs we ship with. 

	* pixmaps/envelope-closed.xpm, pixmaps/envelope-open.xpm: Tigert's
	envelopes incorporated.

2000-03-31  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* message-list.c (ml_value_at): Fix miss-used variable. 

2000-04-01  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_properties_init): update to
	new property  (folder_browser_property_changed): kill.
	(get_prop, set_prop): do the donkey work + make properly RW.

2000-03-31  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (folder_browser_set_shell):
	* folder-browser.c (folder_browser_new):
	* message-list.c (on_row_selection_cmd, select_msg,
	message_list_init, message_list_set_folder):

	remove debugging printf()s that no longer seem useful

2000-03-29  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (control_activate): build a toolbar.
	(control_deactivate): and hide it.

2000-03-27  Chris Toshok <toshok@helixcode.com>
	* mail-display.c: quiet warnings when building in ../po

2000-03-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (folder_browser_set_shell): Memory leak
	fix. 

2000-03-25  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* .cvsignore: Updated .cvsignore.

2000-03-21  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* message-list.c: Properly ref & sink the table and header models.

2000-03-14  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* mail-sources.c: First cut at a mail source selection wizard.
	Basically a rigged demo at this point. Doesn't use camel to get
	its information, and is not yet complete or integrated with the
	mail component. Did I mention that the code is ugly?

2000-03-13  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* folder-browser-factory.c (folder_browser_set_shell): 
	for testing and demonstration purpose, immediately 
	register a fake service.

2000-03-12  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>
