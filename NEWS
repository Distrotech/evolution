Evolution 1.1.1, 2002-09-09
---------------------------
>>>>>>> 1.134

New features:

  * General

    - The toolbar now includes a "New" dropdown menu/button from which
      you can create messages, appointments, etc. from within any
      folder.

    - A new, integrated configuration dialog for all of Evolution is
      now provided.

    - When you use the folder selection dialog, you can now jump to a
      folder just by typing its name and hitting Enter (instead of
      using the arrows or the mouse).

    - You can now specify your default mail, calendar, tasks and
      contacts folders.  The shortcuts in the shortcut bar will always
      point to the default folder; so for example if you have an IMAP
      account you can specify that the INBOX on the IMAP account is
      default and clicking on the Inbox icon on the shortcut bar will
      take you to the INBOX on the IMAP account.

    - Fonts for displaying of HTML mail can now be configured from
      within Evolution (instead of having to use GNOME Control
      Center).

    - You can now make Evolution play a sound, beep, or display a
      message when new mail arrives.  It is also possible to trigger
      these actions based on a filter rule.

    - The behavior of the search bar has been improved, and the UI has
      been integrated better with the menu bar and the rest of the
      system.

    - For the table-based views, you can now define, save and reuse
      view settings using the "View" menu.

    - The Send/Receive button is now always accessible from any
      folder.

    - Easier to build on non-GNU, and non-GCC systems (e.g. MacOS/X,
      HP/UX, Solaris).

    - Now installs some libraries and headers required for external
      module development.

    - You now can drop objects (eg. mail messages, appointments)
      directly to the folders on the shortcut bar (in 1.0.x, you could
      only drop them in the folder folder bar).

    - 

  * Calendar

    - Loading speed has been improved.

    - When you receive an appointment through email, you can choose
      which calendar to update, and if its for an existing appointment
      the folder is automatically detected

    - Calendar importer now supports importing to remote folders.

    - Calendar GUI and alarm daemon now use listeners for the
      configuration.

    - Reaction to calendar backends crashing has been improved.

    - Show status messages for all long calendar operations.

    - Fixed default reminders description (was 'Untitled
      appointment').

    - Included timezone information on VCALENDAR's used in copy/paste.

    - Removed extra space that was displayed for categories without
      icons.

    - Fixed crashes in the alarm daemon.

    - Fixed crashes in calendar related to creating new evolution
      windows.

    - When right clicking, correctly select the underlying date/time.

    - Meeting scheduling improvements; sends replies when you update
      your attendance status, warnings if the user changes a meeting
      they didn't create.

    - Deleting a meeting with a right click will now offer to send a
      cancellation notice.

    - Can accept meeting replies from non-attendees (they become
      attendees).

    - Fixed work day so start can't be before end, its minimum 1 hour
      and the unshaded zone is not rounded to the nearest time
      division (allowing the work hours to be 0:00 to 23:59).

    - Fixed task view to update completion status the same as the
      editor.

    - Fixed leap year problem with day of week.
      
    - Handle "last day of the month" and "last Tuesday of the month"
      type recurrences.

  * Contacts

    - It is now possible to specify which folders are used for
      autocompletion globally.

    - Improved address selection dialog (for sending mail and meeting
      requests).

    - Improved feedback for search results for all backends and the
      UI.

    - SSL/STARTTLS suport for LDAP has been added.

    - Caches are built for local addressbooks to speed up
      autocompletion.

    - Fixed wombat/addressbook crashes dealing with autocompletion, it
      should be much more stable now.

    - Categories on LDAP are now stored using a multivalued attribute
      (category) instead of a comma separated list (categories), so
      searches on categories in ldap actually work.  The old attribute
      is deprecated and should not be used.

    - Standardized some of the static properties of addressbooks, and
      removed some local addressbook logic from the frontend.

    - When editing contacts from the composer entries (To:, CC:), pop
      up the right kind of editor based on the contact type.

    - Much improved LDAP backend responsiveness and performance.

  * Mail

    - New, much faster indexing engine.  This results in faster mail
      incorporation, faster mail display, and faster searches.
      Overall, the new engine should work much better for larger
      folders, and take considerably less space on the disk.

    - Faster POP3 download, using the server's pipeline extensions if
      available.

    - If you type multiple words in the search bar for the
      "... Contains" rules, Evolution will search messages that
      contain all of the words you specified, in any order.

    - More consistent search results for indexed, non-indexed and
      remote folders.

    - UTF8 (Unicode) used for all searches, even with IMAP servers.

    - It is now possible to mark messages for follow-up and other
      flags.  It is also possible to change the color in which a
      specific message is displayed in the mail list.

    - When the message list is sorted by a certain field, it is possible
      to jump to the first item in the list that matches a certain
      string by just typing the first few characters.
							
    - Filters are now updated automatically when the destination folder
      gets moved or removed.

    - A new filter rule allows you to pipe mail through an external
      process to find out whether or not to filter it.

    - You can now specify which folders get synced when switching to
      offline mode.

    - All previously read messages are automatically downloaded for
      offline use.

    - Offline state is preserved between sessions.  Generally, offline
      mode is more stable and complete.

    - STARTTLS support for POP, SMTP and IMAP has been added.

    - IMAP can now handle folder names containing &, -, and UTF-8
      characters.

    - You can have all of your mail Auto-Cc:ed or auto-Bcc:ed to a
      specified set of recipients.

    - SMTP error reporting has been improved.

    - Much improved GnuPG support.  Better pgp/mime interoperability.

    - Improved support for external Maildir, MH, and mailbox folders,
      and trees of folders.  Internally they share more code now and
      are easier to maintain.

    - External mailbox folders can interoperate with pine/mutt/elm
      status flags directly (at slightly performance penalty).  See
      options on the "spool" provider.

    - Many IMAP related bugs fixed.  IMAP now passes current folder
      regression tests.

    - IMAP body search results are now cached.  Vastly improving
      body search vFolder performance with IMAP sources.

    - Optional IPv6 support.

    - Progress bar added to subscribe dialogue.

    - Camel's multithread safe object system streamlined and
      improved.  Many other internal cleanups inside Camel.

    - vFolders can now have an additional column which shows the
      original location of the message.  Particularly useful for Trash
      folder.

    - New messages dont "upset" the thread view as much, if no sorting
      is used.

    - Various vFolder tweaks and fixes.

    - Remote inline HTML images are now downloaded incrementally using
      libsoup and are fully cancellable.

    - Improved quotation display for format=flowed messages.

  * Mail Composer

    - You can now edit a set of signatures within Evolution, and pick
      which signature you want when composing a message.

    - Handling of replies has been improved; in particular, you can
      now paste any text as a quotation, and quotation formatting is
      preserved when switching between HTML and non-HTML mode.

    - Evolution can now generate graphical smileys automatically as
      you type.

    - Quotation logic has been improved, rewrapping long lines in
      replies now preserves quotation marks.

    - Multiple simulataneous language support in the spell checker.

    - Cut & Paste support for html between netscape/mozilla/evolution.

    - Optimized rendering of long messages.
