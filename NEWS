--------------------------------------

There have been no verified sightings of this release.

    text should be displayed correctly in most context in the mailer
    now. The composer no longer sends undeclared 8bit data. (Jeff)

  - The IMAP provider now caches summary info between sessions, so
    startup should be much faster for large folders. (Dan)

    be supported in a later release.) NNTP authentication support.
    Various other NNTP fixes. (Chris Toshok)

  - Drafts, Outbox, and Sent folders now default to showing "To"
    instead of "From" in the header list. Messages output to the Sent
    folder are marked as "Seen". "Send later" on a reply will mark the
    message as having been replied to. (Jeff)

  - Message list "attachment" column is now functional. The
    read/unread state of a fake thread header now matches the state of
    the thread. (NotZed) Message list sorting is more clever (Jeff)

    Print Preview window. (Miguel)

    Ettore)

  - Added interfaces to change the string displayed in the tree view

    interoperability with new calendaring programs.  (JP, Federico)

  - New ultra-cool date range selector, aka little calendar.  (Damon)

  - Plenty of internal refactoring.  (JP, Damon, Federico)

  - Pilot synch work, mostly on pcs infrastructure and some todo work (JP)

  - Added parsing of addresses.  (Jesse Pavel)

  - Converted most of addressbook to UTF8.  (Lauris)

    body.  (Jeff)

  - A first draft of an automated mailing list recognizer
    has been added.  (It will need more/better rules.)  (Ettore)

    view/hide, save, or launch an external viewer.  (Dan)

  - It is no longer necessary to quit and restart after adding a new
    IMAP server.  (Peter)

  - Lots of i18n/charset fixing.  (Lauris)

  - Giant menu reorganization. Most message operations are now in the
    "Message" menu, and folder operations in the "Folder" menu.
    (Ettore, Dan, Peter)

  - "Mark as seen" timeout is now configurable. Mail view remembers
    the location of the message list/message display split.  (Richard
    Hult)

  - New filter category: "On-demand", for filters to be applied
    at arbitrary times rather than during mail incorporation.  (Peter)

  - POP/IMAP config pages allow you to specify a port... this may
    go away in a later release when we support ssl/ssh tunneling
    directly.  (Peter)

  - Reply To All will now remove your own addresses from the recipient
    lists.  (Jesse Pavel)

  - Folders are synced when you switch to another folder now.  (Dan)

  - The IMAP provider is now more robust about dealing with other
    concurrent IMAP clients.  (Jeff)

    reconnect.  This was part of Camel operation cancellation support,
    which unfortunately didn't make it into 0.5.  (Peter)

  - Sent and Outbox folders are now functional.  You now have 2
    options when sending a message - "Send Now" which will send the
    message imediately and "Send Later" which will queue the message in
    Outbox for later sending.  When a message is successfully sent, it
    is copied to the Sent folder for your records.  (Jeff)

ETable:

  - ETree fixes.  (Chris Toshok)

  - Lots of small usability fixes.  (Chris Lahey)

    selector dialog.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Added an utility program to import vCards from Gnomecard.  (Chris
    Lahey)

    button to add the vCard to the addressbook (Chris Lahey, Dan)

  - Inline uuencoded/binhexed "attachment" support (Dan)

  - "Mark All Messages Seen" command.  (Cody Russell)

 Filters / VFolders

  - Major filter/vfolder dialog rewrite (Michael Zucchi) VFolders can
    now search any (searchable) folder, not just Inbox.

  - Auto-filter/auto-vfolder code (right click on a message in the
    list and pick one of the options at the bottom of the menu to
    create a filter/vfolder rule for similar messages).  (Michael)

  - You can now set the color of messages in the message list, based
    on filter rules.  (Local stores can also now store arbitrary user
    flags, although there is not yet UI code to set/view them.)
    (Michael)

  - Added "Save" button to the quicksearch bar to save a search as a
    vfolder.  (Michael)

 Configuration

  - Major mail config dialog rewrite (JP).

  - The mailer now remembers your threaded/unthreaded message view
    setting between sessions.  (Jeremy Wise).

    IMAP servers (JP, Dan)

 Providers

  - You can now leave POP mail on the server. (This will [currently]
    only work right with POP servers that support the UIDL command.
    On other servers, it will never download some messages unless you
    never delete mail.)

  - There is now an MH-like local store available, and code to convert
    a folder from one type to the other.  (Michael)

  - The mbox provider now writes out "From " lines that are more
    compatible with other mailers (like Mutt) that are picky about
    their exact format.  (Michael)

  - The IMAP provider now supports searching (Jeff). Also various
    other speed/efficiency/robustness improvements (Jeff), and support

    locales.  (Ettore)

Mailer:

   - Lots of IMAP fixes.  (Jeff) 

   - You can use an external setuid/setgid movemail program
    (although we don't ship our own yet). If you have one

    that. Otherwise, you can specify --with-movemail=/path.
    (Dan)

  - You can toggle HTML/plain text for an individual message
    in the composer now.  (Ettore)

  - Bonobo embedding sort of works again, but there are
    problems with size allocation somewhere. Attachments can now

    to deal with people who don't put newlines in their mail.
    (Dan)

Mailer:

  Major features:

  * Basic IMAP support (Jeff)

  * Threaded message view (Michael, Chris Toshok)

  * Filters now work (original work by Michael, bugfixes by Dan)


  Smaller features:

  * Implemented moving messages between folders (Dan)

  * Very basic printing support (Dan, but it was only like 5 lines
    of code, because gnome-print kicks ass)

  * "Delete", "Forward", and "Refile" operations now work on
    multiple messages. (Chris Lahey, Peter Williams, Dan)

  * Toggle read/unread flag when the user clicks on the envelope
    icon (Chris Lahey, Dan).

  * The "New folder" menu item now works (Ettore, Dan).

  * The filter/vfolder druid now uses the new shell folder selection
    UI (Michael)

  * Added "Cc" to the set of filter/vfolderable headers and make the
    filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule work with to or cc.
    (Dan)

  * New key bindings: "Delete" deletes the current message and jumps
    to the next undeleted message. "N" and "P" go to next/previous
    unread message. (Dan)

  * Keep asking for POP/IMAP password until the user gets it correct
    or hits Cancel, and remember the result until the user exits (or
    chooses "Forget Passwords"). (Dan, Jeff)

  * Kludge Camel to output ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, since
    neither GtkHTML nor ETable supports UTF-8 still. (Dan)

  * Use the gnome-vfs "sniff buffer" interface to try to identify
    the MIME type of attachments without useful type information
    (Dan)

  * Allow saving drafts in the composer (Ettore)

  * Added "Received date" header to the set of possible message list
    headers. (Dan)

  * Partial gladification of the config dialog (JP Rosevear)


  Bug fixes:

  * Message read/unread/deleted flags should now be saved reliably
    when you exit, and summary should not be rebuilt when a rebuild
    isn't needed. Expunging should work reliably (Dan, Ettore,
    Jeff).

  * Fix disappearing toolbar bug (Dan).

  * Fixed a bug that made downloading of very large messages over
    POP incredibly slow, and various other smaller POP bugs. (Dan)

  * Fixed bugs that made large attachments sometimes get dropped and
    small ones sometimes get truncated. (Dan)

  * Fixed filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule to correctly
    match "to" rather than "from". (Michael)

  * Fix some text/plain formatting bugs in the composer. (Dan,
    Ettore)

  * Turn off search mode when getting new mail (to avoid corrupting
    the display). Make "get mail" always put unfiltered mail into
    Inbox rather than the current folder. (Dan)

  * Fixed a bug that caused "Re:" to be prepended even to subjects
    that started with "Re:" when replying. Added a default subject
    to forwarded messages. (Dan)

  * Make the "Attach" dialog in the composer remember the last
    directory it was in. (Dan)

  * Code to parse invalid date formats since some mailers generate
    them... (Jeff)

  * Fixed various small SMTP bugs (Jeff, Chris Lahey)

  * Fixed some memory leaks (Peter, Jeff)

  * Make replies use the text/plain part of a multipart/alternative
    if the user configured plain text rather than HTML mail sending.
    (Dan)

  * Various config dialog fixes (Jeff)

  * Partial filter/vfolder GUI facelift (Jacob)
