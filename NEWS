Version 0.3 "Jellyfish"
-----------------------

Shell:

  - Pop-up folder selection.  (Ettore)

  - Added support for multiple views.  (Ettore)

  - Added support for saving component-specific settings, and
    some initial code to save the view's configuration.
    (Ettore)

  - Fixed the Bonobo menu code so that it works with all the
    locales.  (Ettore)

Mailer:

   - Lots of IMAP fixes.  (Jeff) 

   - You can use an external setuid/setgid movemail program
    (although we don't ship our own yet). If you have one
    installed with emacs, the configure script will find
    that. Otherwise, you can specify --with-movemail=/path.
    (Dan)

  - You can toggle HTML/plain text for an individual message
    in the composer now.  (Ettore)

  - Bonobo embedding sort of works again, but there are
    problems with size allocation somewhere. Attachments can now
    also be handled by external applications.  (Dan)

  - text/plain mail is now line-wrapped in the mail display,
    to deal with people who don't put newlines in their mail.
    (Dan)

  - Allow user to specify IMAP namespace in the mail config
    dialog.  (Dan, Jeff)

  - Quoted-printable encoder fixes.  (Michael Zucchi)

  - Various NNTP fixes, include a news pane in the config
    dialog.  (Chris Toshok)

  - Some memory corruption fixes.  (Peter Williams)

  - Fix for message not being re-drawn as deleted.  (Peter
    Williams, Jeff)

  - Moving a message to another folder copies the flags now
    (Jeff)

  - Close signature in HTML mail with </PRE>, not <PRE>, and
    default to ~/.signature.  (Michael Meeks)

  - Fixed some confusing behavior in the message threading
    algorithm.  (Dan)

  - Improvements to the item selection code.  (Chris Lahey)

Calendar:

  - Added support for a bunch of previously unsupported iCalendar
    properties.  (Federico)

  - Conduit for synchronizing the calendar with gnome-pilot
    (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Seth)

  - ETable-based to-do list view ("taskpad"), for your viewing
    pleasure.

Addressbook:

  - Conduit for synchronizing the addressbook with gnome-pilot
    (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Chris Toshok)

  - Conduit for synchronizing the addressbook with gnome-pilot
    (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Chris Toshok)

  - Fixed some random crashes.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Implemented a vCard Bonobo control so that we can support
    inline vCard viewing in the mailer.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Quick search looks at both the name and the company name now.
    (Chris Lahey)

  - Added more functionality to the contact editor's toolbar.  (Chris
    Lahey)

Mailer:

  Major features:

  * Basic IMAP support (Jeff)

  * Threaded message view (Michael, Chris Toshok)

  * Filters now work (original work by Michael, bugfixes by Dan)


  Smaller features:

  * Implemented moving messages between folders (Dan)

  * Very basic printing support (Dan, but it was only like 5 lines
    of code, because gnome-print kicks ass)

  * "Delete", "Forward", and "Refile" operations now work on
    multiple messages. (Chris Lahey, Peter Williams, Dan)

  * Toggle read/unread flag when the user clicks on the envelope
    icon (Chris Lahey, Dan).

  * The "New folder" menu item now works (Ettore, Dan).

  * The filter/vfolder druid now uses the new shell folder selection
    UI (Michael)

  * Added "Cc" to the set of filter/vfolderable headers and make the
    filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule work with to or cc.
    (Dan)

  * New key bindings: "Delete" deletes the current message and jumps
    to the next undeleted message. "N" and "P" go to next/previous
    unread message. (Dan)

  * Keep asking for POP/IMAP password until the user gets it correct
    or hits Cancel, and remember the result until the user exits (or
    chooses "Forget Passwords"). (Dan, Jeff)

  * Kludge Camel to output ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, since
    neither GtkHTML nor ETable supports UTF-8 still. (Dan)

  * Use the gnome-vfs "sniff buffer" interface to try to identify
    the MIME type of attachments without useful type information
    (Dan)

  * Allow saving drafts in the composer (Ettore)

  * Added "Received date" header to the set of possible message list
    headers. (Dan)

  * Partial gladification of the config dialog (JP Rosevear)


  Bug fixes:

  * Message read/unread/deleted flags should now be saved reliably
    when you exit, and summary should not be rebuilt when a rebuild
    isn't needed. Expunging should work reliably (Dan, Ettore,
    Jeff).

  * Fix disappearing toolbar bug (Dan).

  * Fixed a bug that made downloading of very large messages over
    POP incredibly slow, and various other smaller POP bugs. (Dan)

  * Fixed bugs that made large attachments sometimes get dropped and
    small ones sometimes get truncated. (Dan)

  * Fixed filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule to correctly
    match "to" rather than "from". (Michael)

  * Fix some text/plain formatting bugs in the composer. (Dan,
    Ettore)

  * Turn off search mode when getting new mail (to avoid corrupting
    the display). Make "get mail" always put unfiltered mail into
    Inbox rather than the current folder. (Dan)

  * Fixed a bug that caused "Re:" to be prepended even to subjects
    that started with "Re:" when replying. Added a default subject
    to forwarded messages. (Dan)

  * Make the "Attach" dialog in the composer remember the last
    directory it was in. (Dan)

  * Code to parse invalid date formats since some mailers generate
    them... (Jeff)

  * Fixed various small SMTP bugs (Jeff, Chris Lahey)

  * Fixed some memory leaks (Peter, Jeff)

  * Make replies use the text/plain part of a multipart/alternative
    if the user configured plain text rather than HTML mail sending.
    (Dan)

  * Various config dialog fixes (Jeff)

  * Partial filter/vfolder GUI facelift (Jacob)
