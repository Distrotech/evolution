WARNING

Evolution 1.1.1 is a BETA quality release.  This means that it has
bugs, including possibly destructive bugs that can cause valuable data
to be lost.

For this reason, please make sure you back up your mail and your
calendar/addressbook information before using Evolution 1.1.1 on them.
In particular, you are strongly advised to backup the `evolution'
directory in your home directory if you are upgrading from a 1.0.x
version of Evolution to Evolution 1.1.1.


UPGRADING FROM 1.0.x

The format of certain configuration files has changed in this version
of Evolution.  When you start Evolution 1.1.1 for the first time, it
will automatically migrate your configuration so that it will work as
expected with this version.

If you want to return to a 1.0.x version after trying 1.1.1, you have
to restore the original configuration files.  From the command-line,
you can do the following, after having quit Evolution:

	killev
	cd ~/evolution
	mv filters.xml.bak-1.0 filters.xml
	mv vfolders.xml.bak-1.0 vfolders.xml
	mv shortcuts.xml.bak-1.0 shortcuts.xml

	[FIXME what about the IMAP cache?]

Note that any changes to filters, vfolders or shortcuts made with
1.1.1 will be lost after this operation.

Also note that the upgrade mechanism runs automatically only the first
time you run 1.1.1.  For this reason, if you run Evolution 1.1.1, then
go back to 1.0 using the aforementioned procedure, and then go back to
using 1.1.1 again, the settings will not be upgraded.

To force the upgrade to happen again in this case, use the following
command to start Evolution 1.1.1:

	evolution --force-upgrade


SEARCH CRITERIA CHANGES

When you specify multiple words in search "contains" criterion,
Evolution will now search the mail messages that contain all the words
specified, in any order.  (The 1.0.x behavior was to look for the
whole string in "subject contains" matches, and matched no messages in
the case of body searches.)

This applies to the search bar, the filter rules and the vfolder
rules.  Filter rules and vfolder rules might need to be re-adjusted
after you upgrade to version 1.1.1.
