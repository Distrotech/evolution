  This is the stable branch of Evolution.  As a consequence, any
commit to this branch is subject to a patch review mechanism, as
defined by the following rules:

    1. Every patch will be sent to evolution-patches@ximian.com in the
       form of a unified diff (cvs diff -u).

    2. Every patch will have to be on the list for at least 24 hours
       before being committed.  A week-end (Saturday+Sunday) counts as
       a single 24-hour day.

       If a patch is by one of the core contributors of the module the
       patch refers to and no-one speaks up against it in the 24 hour
       period, the author can go ahead and commit the patch.

       On the other hand, patches by people who are not core
       contributors of the module being patched will always have to be
       confirmed as safe by one of the core contributors first.

    3. As an exception to rule 2, if the patch gets approved by all
       the core developers of the module before the 24-hour period, it
       may get committed immediately.  This doesn't apply to the
       modules that have only one core maintainer though (e.g. the
       shell); in that case, the patch will have to be approved by at
       least one core developer of another module in order to be
       committed before the 24-hour period.

    4. Core contributors are required to give their opinion on the bug
       in the 24 hour period.

    5. Core module members are defined as follows:

    6. Patches must be attached to bugs that are actually on the
       Bugzilla, and the bug # must be specified when sending the patch
       to the list.

    7. Once the patch has been committed, it is the author's
       responsibility to:

        - Close the corresponding bug on Bugzilla.

        - Write to the mailing list, replying to the original message
          containing the patch to inform the other hackers that the
          patch has been committed.

	- Update NEWS with a listing of the changes applied and
          corresponding Ximian Bugzilla bug numbers.
