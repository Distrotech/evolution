<!-- ##### ENUM CalClientLoadStatus ##### -->
  <para>
    These values describe the status of a calendar load or create
    request.  After asking a calendar factory to load or create a
    calendar, the provided listener will get notification about the
    result in asynchronous fashion.  Such notification is represented
    by one of these enumeration values.  For values other than
    #CAL_CLIENT_LOAD_SUCCESS, the #CalClient object will not accept
    any other operations on the calendar and it should just be
    destroyed.
