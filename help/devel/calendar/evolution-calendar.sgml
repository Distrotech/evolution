    <title>Developing Applications for the Evolution Calendar</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>
	This part of the Evolution Developer's Guide describes how to
	write applications for the Evolution Calendar by using its
	public interfaces.  The Evolution Calendar exports its
	functionality through a number of interfaces, including CORBA,
	GTK+ wrappers for Bonobo objects, and other utility libraries.
      </para>

      <para>
	You should read this part of the Evolution Developer's guide
	if you intend to write client applications that use the
	functionality of the Evolution Calendar.
      </para>

      <para>
	This part does not describe the internal interfaces of the
	Evolution Calendar; for that you should read the Evolution
	Internals Guide.  You should only need to read that guide if
	you are interested in the way the calendar works internally or
	if you want to make changes directly to the Evolution Calendar
	code.
