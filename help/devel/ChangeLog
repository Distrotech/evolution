	* calendar/cal-client/Makefile.am: Likewise.

	* calendar/cal-util/Makefile.am: Likewise.

2000-12-19  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	Added proper dependency lists to the gtk-doc mess.

	* calendar/cal-client/Makefile.am (TARGET_DIR): Removed unused
	variable.
	(SOURCE_FILES): New variable with the list of source files we
	depend on.
	(IGNORED_SOURCE_HEADERS): New variable with the headers we ignore
	for the gtkdoc-scan phase.
	(scan_generated):
	(tmpl_dependencies):
	(tmpl_sources):
	(tmpl_generated);
	(sgml_dependencies):
	(sgml_generated): Lists of stuff that is generated and that other
	stuff depends on.
	(all): Added the $(sgml_generated) as the final target.
	(install-data-local): Added an installation hook; gtk-doc seems to
	want some of its generated files to be installed.

	* calendar/cal-client/evolution-cal-client-sections.txt: Updated.

	* calendar/cal-util/Makefile.am: Made the same changes as for
	calendar/cal-client/Makefile.am.

	* calendar/cal-util/evolution-cal-util-sections.txt: Updated.

	* Makefile.am (local_entities): Added alarm-generation.sgml.
	(all): Made the main target be the html/index.html.

2000-12-18  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	the algorithm used to generate alarm instances.

	* calendar/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added alarm-generation.sgml.

2000-12-13  Larry Ewing  <lewing@helixcode.com>

	* calendar/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): make it public-reference.sgml
	not referenc.sgml here.

2000-11-29  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* calendar/architecture.sgml: Finished the calendar architecture
	chapter.

2000-11-29  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* evolution-devel-guide.sgml: Added an id for the API reference <part>.
	Added the FDL <legalnotice>.
	Added the preface and toplevel reference entities.
	Added entities for Evolution, Wombat, and Camel.
	Added an appendix for the GNU FDL.
	
	* preface.sgml: New file with the introduction to the Evolution
	Developer's Guide.

	* reference.sgml: Split the toplevel reference part into its own
	file.

	* fdl.sgml: Added the GNU Free Documentation License.

	Moved this file over from calendar/reference.sgml.

	* Makefile.am (local_entities): Added a list of the SGML files
	that define entities for inclusion in the toplevel document.  This
	way we can track documentation file dependencies down to all
	levels.
	(html/index.html): Made the toplevel document depend on
	$(local_entities).  Also, removed the "html" target and put its
	contents directly here; this way we avoid having .PHONY targets.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Removed the evolution_devel_guideDATA; it made no
	sense.
	(content_files): Added preface.sgml and reference.sgml.

2000-09-15  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	for new API.

2000-08-09  Peter Williams  <peterw@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (maintainer-clean-local): Don't depend
	on 'clean'; this messes up maintainer-clean.

	* evolution-devel-guide.sgml: New <book> toplevel for the
