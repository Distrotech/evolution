            Your computer needs to recognize and access your handheld.
            At this time, <application>Ximian Evolution</application> only
            supports Palm-OS devices like the PalmPilot and the
            Handspring Visor.

           You should decide what sort of synchronization behavior you
           want.

       If you haven't used a handheld device with your computer
       before, you'll need to run the GNOME <application>Control
       Center</application> by selecting
       <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu><guimenuitem>Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice>,
       and make sure that <application>Pilot Link</application> is
       properly configured.

    <para>
        Once your computer and your Palm-OS device are talking happily
        to each other, select the <glossterm
        linkend="conduit">conduits</glossterm> you want under the
        <guilabel>Pilot Conduits</guilabel> section of the Control
        Center.  You may use conduits to synchronize data with several
        applications; the <application>Ximian Evolution</application>
        conduits are labelled <guilabel>EAddress</guilabel>, for the
        contacts in your addressbook, <guilabel>ECalendar</guilabel>,
        for your calendar, and <guilabel>ETodo</guilabel>, for your
        task list.

      To enable a conduit, click the
        <guibutton>Enable</guibutton> to enable it, and click
        <guibutton>Settings</guibutton> to change what it will do when
        activated.  Your options may vary depending on the conduit,
        but typically they will be:
