    To begin using the calendar, select
    <guibutton>Calendar</guibutton> from the <interface>shortcut
    bar</interface>.  By default, the calendar starts showing today's
    schedule on a ruled background.  At the upper right, there's a
    monthly calendar you can use to switch days.  Below that, there's
    a <guilabel>TaskPad</guilabel>, where you can keep a list of tasks
    separate from your calendar appointments.  The calendar's daily
    view is shown in <xref linkend="usage-calendar-fig">.

       The toolbar offers you four different views of your calendar:
       one day, five days, a week, or a month at once. Press the
       calendar-shaped buttons on the right side of the toolbar to
       switch between views. You can also select a range of
       days&mdash; three days, ten days, a fortnight if you want
       &mdash; in the small calendar at the upper right.

       If you're looking at only one day, you'll see tomorrow's page,
       or yesterday's.  If you're looking at your calendar by week,
       month, fortnight, or anything else, you'll move around by just
       that much. To come back to today's listing, click

        Your event must have a starting and ending date &mdash; by
        default, today &mdash; but you can choose whether to give it
        starting and ending times or to mark it as an <guilabel>All
        day event</guilabel>. An <guilabel>All day event</guilabel>
        appears at the top of a day's event list rather than inside
        it.  That makes it easy to have events that overlap and fit
        inside each other.  For example, a conference might be an all
        day event, and the meetings at the conference would be timed
        events.  Of course, events with specific starting and ending
        times can also overlap.  When they do they're displayed as
        multiple columns in the day view of the calendar.
