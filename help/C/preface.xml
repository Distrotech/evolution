      are new to Evolution or to groupware in general, this section is
      for you. The second section, covering <link

      advanced users, but anyone who wants to change the way Evolution
      looks or acts can benefit from reading it.

        Even if you're already familiar with earlier versions,
        Evolution &appversion; has a lot of new features to offer.

                Novell Evolution &appversion; includes trainable
                Bayesian junk mail filters. When you get mail you
                don't want, click the <guilabel>Junk</guilabel> button
              in the toolbar. Check your <guilabel>Junk
              Mail</guilabel> folder periodically to see if it's
              filtered out anything you want to keep, and mark it as
              <guilabel>Not Junk.</guilabel> As you correct the
              filter, it will become more effective.

            <para>
              To set the browser used for links from email addresses,
              open the GNOME preferences tool

            Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
            or <command>gnome-control-center</command>) and click
            <guilabel>File Associations</guilabel>. On some systems,
            this may be called <guilabel>MIME Types</guilabel> or
            <guilabel>Default Applications</guilabel>.

             <guilabel>World wide web (http)</guilabel>, then select
             the browser of your choice. If you wish to use a
             browser other than the ones suggested, you will need to
             enter a complete shell command, rather than just the
             browser name: <userinput>mybrowser
             `%s`</userinput> rather than
             <guilabel>My Browser</guilabel>.
             Some systems may require you to set the browser used for
             https:// links seperately.

          <listitem>
            <para>
              For GNOME desktops, you can set
              Evolution to be the default
              mail client, so that it opens when you click a mailto:
              link in web pages and help tools. To do that, open the
              GNOME preferences tool and start the <guilabel>File
              Associations</guilabel> tool.  There, look under
              <guilabel>Internet Services</guilabel>, select
              <guilabel>Electronic mail transmission
              (mailto)</guilabel>, and select
              <guilabel>Evolution</guilabel> from the drop-down
              list.
            </para>
            <para>
              If you are using KDE, you can also set Evolution as the
              default through the KDE control center. Go to the
              <guilabel>KDE Components</guilabel> section and select
              <guilabel>Component Chooser</guilabel>, then
              <guilabel>Email Client</guilabel>. Click the
              <guilabel>Use a different email client</guilabel> option
              and enter <userinput>evolution `%s`</userinput>.
            </para>
            <para>
              For applications such as Mozilla and Netscape, which do
              not use the GNOME preference tools, you will need to
              find the protocol handler preference tool for that
              application and enter <userinput>evolution
            `%s`</userinput> as your choice for handling mailto links.
