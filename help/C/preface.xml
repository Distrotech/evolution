      <para>
        If you're already familiar with Ximian Evolution 1.2, there
        are a number of new features in this version. Most of the
        changes, however, have been made behind the scenes, as we
        moved to the GNOME 2 platform. Ximian Connector for Microsoft
        Exchange also has new features, described in <xref linkend="new-in-connector" />.
        You can find a complete list of bugs fixed and features added
        in the Evolution release notes at the <ulink

              your backup disk.  To access data you

              To set the browser that opens when you click a link in

              (<menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu><guimenuitem>Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
            or <command>gnome-control-center</command>) and start the
            <guilabel>File Associations</guilabel> tool. There, look under
            <guilabel>Internet Services</guilabel>, select
             <guilabel>World wide web (http)</guilabel>, and select
             the browser of your choice. If you wish to use a 
             browser other than the ones suggested, you will need to
             enter the full shell command. For example you might use 
             <userinput>mybrowser "%s"</userinput> to start the
             mybrowser program at the right page.

            <para>
              For GNOME desktops, you can set
              <application>Evolution</application> to be the default
              mail client, so that it opens when you click a mailto:
              link in web pages and help tools. To do that, open the
              GNOME preferences tool and start the <guilabel>File
              Associations</guilabel> tool.  There, look under
              <guilabel>Internet Services</guilabel>, select
              <guilabel>Electronic mail transmission
              (mailto)</guilabel>, and select

              list.

            <para>
              For applications such as Mozilla and Netscape, which do
              not use the GNOME preference tools, you will need to
              find the protocol handler preference tool for that
              application and enter <userinput>evolution
            "%s"</userinput> as your choice for handling mailto links.
