        This book is divided into two parts, with several
        appendices. The first part is a <link linkend="usage">guided
        tour</link>, which will explain how to use
        Evolution.  If you are new to
        Evolution or to groupware in
        general, this section is for you. The second section, covering
        <link linkend="config">configuration</link>, is targeted at
        more advanced users, but anyone who wants to change the way
        Evolution looks or acts can benefit
        from reading it.

              your backup disk.  To access data you
              have backed up, use the <guilabel>Import</guilabel> tool to

              To set the browser that opens when you click a link in
              an email, open the GNOME preferences tool
              (<menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu><guimenuitem>Personal Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
            or <command>gnome-control-center</command>) and start the
            <guilabel>File Associations</guilabel> tool. There, look under
            <guilabel>Internet Services</guilabel>, select
             <guilabel>World wide web (http)</guilabel>, and select
             the browser of your choice. If you wish to use a 
             browser other than the ones suggested, you will need to
             enter the full shell command. For example you might use 
             <userinput>mybrowser "%s"</userinput> to start the
             mybrowser program at the right page.

          <listitem>
            <para>
              For GNOME desktops, you can set
              Evolution to be the default
              mail client, so that it opens when you click a mailto:
              link in web pages and help tools. To do that, open the
              GNOME preferences tool and start the <guilabel>File
              Associations</guilabel> tool.  There, look under
              <guilabel>Internet Services</guilabel>, select
              <guilabel>Electronic mail transmission
              (mailto)</guilabel>, and select
              <guilabel>Evolution</guilabel> from the drop-down
              list.
            </para>
            <para>
              For applications such as Mozilla and Netscape, which do
              not use the GNOME preference tools, you will need to
              find the protocol handler preference tool for that
              application and enter <userinput>evolution
            "%s"</userinput> as your choice for handling mailto links.
