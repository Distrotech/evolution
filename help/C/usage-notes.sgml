    <para>
      In the dark ages before email was invented, there were little
      scraps of people which people used for short-term information
      storage.  These scraps of paper were called notes.  Now, notes
      are an almost necessary part of our lives, albeit in electronic
      form.  It only makes sense, then, that
      <application>Evolution</application> has a Notes feature.

      the following ways:
