        To change your configuration settings, select
        <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem> from the
        <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu.  This will open the
        preferences window, illustrated in <xref linkend="config-prefs-fig">.
        Preferences are seperated into several categories:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
	    <para>
               <guilabel>Identity</guilabel>, which allows you to set
               your name, email address, and other information.  The
               default values are the ones found on your system account.
	    </para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              <guilabel>Mail</guilabel>, which allows you to specify
              your email server and protocols, as well as attachment
              and HTML handling, forwarding behavior, filters, and
              other <application>Evolution</application> behaviors
              specific to email.  The default behaviors are those

              up calendar networking, as well as the way that your
              calendar will behave and appear.  The default view is by
              week and the default calendar is Western.  Time and
              date are determined by the system clock and
              localization, and cannot be set here.

      <para>
         If you have only one email address, or use automatic
         forwarding to funnel multiple addresses into one, then you
         will only need to configure one identity. To create a single
         user with a single identity, enter the following information:
         (INSERT detailed DESCRIPTION HERE)

           If you use multiple network connections&mdash;if, for
           example, you dial up an ISP for your personal mail, and use
           a LAN for your work-related tasks&mdash; you will also have
           to set seperate network settings for each identity.

      <title>Setting up the Network</title> 
      <para>
        In order to do much of anything with
        <application>Evolution</application>, you need to connect to
        your network.  To do that, you'll need to know your user name
        and password, what sort of mail sending and receiving
        protocols your network uses, and the names of the servers
        you'll be using.  If you're switching from another groupware
        or email progam, you can almost certainly use the same
        settings as you did with that program.  Select the
        <guibutton>Network</guibutton> tab in the
        <interface>Preferences</interface> window to get started.
