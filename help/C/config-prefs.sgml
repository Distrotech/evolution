<!--this chapter needs a LOT of work.  structurally it needs for the
mail and other sections to be similar.  it needs content in the
Calendar section and the Contact section.  Calendar prefs functions
documentation-ready, although subject to substantial change. Contact
functions are not yet available for doc'ing.  . aaron, june 5. 7 am.

      <title>Advanced Configuration</title>
      <para>
        Perhaps your mail server has changed names.  Perhaps you've
        grown tired of a certain layout for your appointments.
        Whatever the reason, you want to change your
        <application>Evolution</application> settings.  This chapter
        will tell you how to do just that.
      </para>

       <sect1 id="config-prefs-mail">
         <title>Mail Settings</title>
        <para>
        To change your mail settings, first go to your
        <interface>Inbox</interface>.  Then select <guimenuitem>Mail
        Settings</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Tools</guimenu> menu.
        This will open the <interface>mail preferences
        window</interface>, illustrated in <xref
        linkend="config-prefs-mail-fig">.  Mail Preferences are
        seperated into several categories:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
	    <para>
               <guilabel>Identity</guilabel>, which allows you to set
               your name, email address, and other information.  The
               default values are the ones found on your system account.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              <guilabel>Sources</guilabel>, which allows you to specify
              your mail receiving server and protocols.
            </para>
          </listitem>

        <listitem>
         <para>
           <guilabel>Transports</guilabel>, which allows you to
           specify how you will send mail.

      <para>
         If you have only one email address, or use automatic
         forwarding to funnel multiple addresses to one account, then
         you will only need to configure one identity. You may,
         however, want more that one.  To alter an identity, click on
         it in the <guilabel>Identity</guilabel> tab of the
         <interface>Preferences</interface> window, and then click
         <guibutton>Edit</guibutton>. To add a new identity, simply
         click <guibutton>Add</guibutton>.
      </para>

      <para>
         In either case, you'll be presented with a dialog box with
         four fields:

           <listitem>
	    <para>
              <guilabel>Full Name:</guilabel> by default, this is the
              same name as the full name described in your user
              account on your computer.

              small text file to be appended to every message that you
              send.  Typically, signature files include address or
              other contact information, or a favorite quotation.
              They should not be more than three lines long.

    <sect2 id="config-prefs-mail-network">
      <title>Network Settings</title> 
      <para>
        In order to do much of anything with
        <application>Evolution</application>, you need to connect to
        your network.  To do that, you'll need to know your user name
        and password, what sort of mail sending and receiving
        protocols your network uses, and the names of the servers
        you'll be using.  If you're switching from another groupware
        or email progam, you can almost certainly use the same
        settings as you did with that program.  Select the
        <guibutton>Sources</guibutton> tab in the
        <interface>Preferences</interface> window to tell
        <application>Evolution</application> where you want to get
        your mail, and click <guibutton>Transports</guibutton> to
        determine how you want to send your mail.

	<sect3 id="config-prefs-network-sources">
	  <title>Mail Sources</title>

            The <interface>Mail Sources</interface> tab allows you to
            edit, add, or delete methods of retreiving mail from
            servers.  Clicking on <guibutton>Add</guibutton> or
            <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> will bring up a dialog box to
            offer you the following options:

           <listitem>
	    <para>
              <guilabel>Mail source type:</guilabel>At this point, you
              can only select from POP or Unix-style mbox files, but
              additional types will be supported in the future.

	    <para>
              <guilabel>Authentication:</guilabel> Your system
              administrator will know which type of authentication
              your system requires.
              <application>Evolution</application> can also detect
              what sorts of authentication are available once it knows
              where to find the server.

              <application>Evolution</application> will attempt to

            The <interface>Transports</interface> tab lets you set how
            you will send mail.  As of this writing, you have two
            choices: <guilabel>SMTP</guilabel>, which uses a remote
            mail server, and <guilabel>sendmail</guilabel>,
            which uses the <application>sendmail</application> program
            on your local system.
         </para>
         <para>
            If you choose <guilabel>SMTP</guilabel>, you will need
            to know the name of your mail server.  Your system
            administrator or ISP has probably included that
            information on the piece of paper you lost about five
            minutes ago.  <application>Evolution</application> can
            attempt to determine if you have entered the right
            server name.  To have it do so,
            check the box labelled <guilabel>Test these values before
            continuing</guilabel> before you click

          If you check this box, you will send messages as HTML.  If
          you leave it unchecked, your messages will be sent without
          HTML formatting.  See <xref
