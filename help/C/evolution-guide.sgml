      <para>
        Part one of the <application>Evolution</application> manual
        describes how to use <application>Evolution</application>
        for email, contact management, and appointment and task
        scheduling.  You'll find as you go along that, as with most of
        Linux, there's more than one way to do things, and you can
        pick whichever method you like best.

    <partintro>
      <para>
        <application>Evolution</application> is highly configurable.
        Usually, when developers say that, they mean that they didn't
        test it out thoroughly and have left it to other hackers to
        "configure" themselves a working system.  When we say
        configurable, we mean that although
        <application>Evolution</application> will work perfectly well
        with minimal setup hassle, you can alter its behavior to fit
        your needs with just a little more work.
