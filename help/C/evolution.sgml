      <para>
        Part one of the <application>Ximian Evolution</application> manual
        describes how to use <application>Ximian Evolution</application> for
        email, contact management, and appointment and task
        scheduling.  You'll find as you go along that there's more
        than one way to do things, and you can pick whichever method
        you like best.

  <title>Configuring and Managing Ximian Evolution</title>
    <partintro>
      <para>
        <application>Ximian Evolution</application> is highly
        configurable.  Usually, when developers say that, they mean
        that they didn't test it out thoroughly and have left it to
        other programmers to "configure" themselves a working
        system. In the case of <application>Ximian
        Evolution</application>, "configurable", it means that, while
        you can expect the program to work perfectly well in its
        default settings, it's also easy to alter its behavior in a
        wide variety of ways, so that it fits your needs exactly.
        This part of the book will describe that process, from the
        quickest glimpse of the Setup Assistant to an in-depth tour of
        the preferences dialogs.
