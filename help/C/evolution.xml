  <title>Getting Started</title>
  <para>Evolution&trade; makes the tasks of storing, organizing, and retrieving your personal information easier, so you can work and communicate more effectively with others. It&apos;s a highly evolved <link linkend="groupware">groupware</link> program, an integral part of the Internet-connected desktop.</para>
  <para>Evolution can help you work in a group by handling e-mail, address, and other contact information, and one or more calendars. It can do that on one or several computers, connected directly or over a network, for one person or for large groups.</para>
  <para>With Evolution, you can accomplish your most common daily tasks faster. For example, it takes only one or two clicks to enter appointment or contact information sent to you by e-mail, or to send e-mail to a contact or appointment. Evolution makes displays faster and more efficient, so searches are faster and memory usage is lower. People who get lots of e-mail will appreciate advanced features like <link linkend="vfolder">vFolders</link>, which let you save searches as though they were ordinary e-mail folders.</para>

    <title>Using the First-Run Assistant</title>
    <para>The first time you run Evolution, it creates a directory called evolution in your home directory, where it stores all of its local data. Then, it opens a first-run assistant to help you set up e-mail accounts and import data from other applications.</para>
    <para>Using the first-run assistant takes approximately two to five minutes.</para>
    <para>Later on, if you want to change this account, or if you want to create a new one, select Tools &gt; Settings, then click Mail Accounts. Select the account you want to change, then click Edit. Alternately, add a new account by clicking Add. See <link linkend="config-prefs-mail">Mail Preferences</link> for details.</para>

     </informalfigure>
     <para>The Receiving E-mail option lets you determine where you get your e-mail. You need to specify the type of server you want to receive mail with. If you are unsure about the type of server to choose, ask your system administrator or ISP. The following is a list of server types:</para>
     <formalpara id="bsj74dr">
      <title>GroupWise:</title>
      <para> Select this option if you connect to GroupWise&reg;. GroupWise keeps e-mail, calendar, and contact information on the server.</para>
     </formalpara>
     <formalpara id="bsj74ds">
      <title>Microsoft Exchange:</title>
      <para> Available only if you have installed the Connector for Microsoft&z-3rdParty; Exchange. It allows you to connect to a Microsoft Exchange 2000 or 2003 server, which stores e-mail, calendar, and contact information on the server.</para>
     </formalpara>
     <formalpara id="bsj74dt">
      <title>IMAP:</title>
      <para> Keeps the e-mail on your server so you can access your e-mail from multiple systems.</para>
     </formalpara>
     <formalpara id="bsj74du">
      <title>POP:</title>
      <para> Downloads your e-mail to your hard disk for permanent storage, freeing up space on the e-mail server.</para>
     </formalpara>
     <formalpara id="bsj74dv">
      <title>Local Delivery:</title>
      <para> Choose this option if you want to move e-mail from the spool (the location where mail waits for delivery) and store it in your home directory. You need to provide the path to the mail spool you want to use. If you would rather leave e-mail in your system&apos;s spool files, choose the Standard Unix Mbox Spool option instead. </para>
     </formalpara>
     <formalpara id="bsj74dw">
      <title>MH Format Mail Directories:</title>
      <para> If you download your e-mail using mh or another MH-style program, you should use this option. You need to provide the path to the mail directory you want to use.</para>
     </formalpara>
     <formalpara id="bsj74dx">
      <title>Maildir Format Mail Directories:</title>
      <para> If you download your e-mail using Qmail or another maildir-style program, you should use this option. You need to provide the path to the mail directory you want to use.</para>
     </formalpara>
     <formalpara id="bsj74dy">
      <title>Standard Unix Mbox Spool or Directory:</title>
      <para> If you want to read and store e-mail in the mail spool on your local system, choose this option. You need to provide the path to the mail spool you want to use.</para>
     </formalpara>
     <formalpara id="bsj74dz">
      <title>None:</title>
      <para> Select this if you do not plan to check e-mail with this account.</para>
     </formalpara>
     <para>If you selected POP, IMAP, GroupWise, or Microsoft Exchange as your e-mail server, you&rsquo;ll need to specify additional information:</para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>The hostname of your e-mail server. Ask  your system administrator if you&apos;re not sure.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>The username for the account on that system. </para>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>The authentication options supported by your server. If you&apos;re not sure, ask your system administrator. You can also click Check for Supported Types; when you have done so, the menu limits itself to options your server supports. Some servers do not announce the authentication mechanisms they support, so clicking this button is not a guarantee that available mechanisms actually work.  </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>Choose whether you want Evolution to remember your password. If you have selected this item, you can force Evolution to ask for a password again by clicking Actions &gt; Forget Passwords, or by returning to this section of the accounts tool, which you can find by clickiing Tools &gt; Settings.  </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>If you are connecting to GroupWise, you need your SOAP port number for accessing your Address Book and Calendar.</para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     <tip>
      <para>Connecting to an Exchange Server</para>
      <para>If you have installed the Connector for Microsoft Exchange, you can access Microsoft Exchange 2000 servers natively. If you do not have the Connector, or if you use an older version of Microsoft Exchange, talk to your system administrator about access to standard protocol services like POP and IMAP.</para>

       <para>For IMAP mail servers, your system administrator might provide you with a specific namespace, which is the directory where your server stores mail for you. If you check your IMAP mail and your folder list includes files that don&rsquo;t look like mail folders, you probably need to change your mail namespace. Typical values are "mail" and "Mail.&rdquo;  If you prefer, you can choose to subscribe to individual mail folders one at a time.

   <para>The toolbar gives you fast and easy access to the frequently used features in each component.</para>
   <para><emphasis>Shortcut Bar</emphasis></para>
   <para>The shortcut bar lets you switch between folders and between Evolution tools. At the bottom of the shortcut bar there are buttons that let you switch tools, and above that is a list of all the available folders for the current tool. If you have the Evolution Connector for Microsoft Exchange installed, you have an Exchange button in addition to buttons for the other tools. For additional information, see <link linkend="usage-mainwindow-shortcutbar">The Shortcut Bar</link>.</para>
   <para><emphasis>Status Bar</emphasis></para>
   <para>The status bar periodically displays a message, or tells you the progress of a task. This most often happens when you&apos;re checking or sending e-mail. These progress queues are shown here, in the status bar. The Online/Offline indicator is here, too, in the lower left of the window.</para>

   <para>The search tool lets you search through your e-mail to easily find what you&rsquo;re looking for.</para>

   <section id="usage-mainwindow-shortcutbar">
    <title>The Shortcut Bar</title>
    <para>Evolution&apos;s most important job is to give you access to your information and help you use it quickly. One way it does that is through the shortcut bar, the column on the left side of the main window. The buttons, such as Mail and Contacts, are the shortcuts. Above them is a list of folders for the current Evolution tool.</para>
    <para>The folder list organizes your e-mail, calendars, contact lists, and task lists in a tree, similar to a <link linkend="filetree">file tree</link>. Most people will find one to four folders at the base of the tree, depending on the tool and their system configuration. Each Evolution tool has at least one, called On This Computer, for local information. For example, the folder list for the e-mail tool shows any remote e-mail storage you have set up, plus local folders and vFolders, or virtual folders, discussed in <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vfolders">Using vFolders</link>. </para>
    <para>If you get large amounts of e-mail, you might want more folders than just your Inbox; you can also create multiple calendar, task, or contacts folders. </para>

    <title>Introducing E-Mail</title>
    <para>Evolution e-mail is like other e-mail programs in several ways:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>It can sort and organize your e-maile-mail in a wide variety of ways with folders, searches, and filters. </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>It can send and receive e-mail in HTML or as plain text, and makes it easy to send and receive multiple file attachments. </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>It supports multiple e-mail sources, including <link linkend="imap">IMAP</link>, <link linkend="pop">POP3</link>, and local mbox or mh spools and files created by other e-mail programs.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>It lets you guard your privacy with encryption.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>However, Evolution has some important differences from other e-mail programs. First, it&rsquo;s built to handle very large amounts of e-mail. The <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-spam">junk e-mail</link>, message <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link> functions were built for speed and efficiency on large volumes of e-mail. There&apos;s also the <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vfolders">vFolder</link>, an advanced organizational feature not found in some e-mail clients. If you get a lot of e-mail, or if you keep every message you get in case you need to refer to it later, you&apos;ll find this feature especially useful. Here&apos;s a quick explanation of what&apos;s happening in your main Evolution e-mail window. </para>
    <informalfigure id="usage-mail-intro-fig">

    <para><emphasis>E-Mail List</emphasis></para>
    <para>The message list displays all the e-mails that you have. This includes all your read and unread messages, and e-mail that is flagged to be deleted.</para>
    <para><emphasis>E-Mail Preview</emphasis></para>
    <para>This is where your e-mail is displayed.</para>
    <para>If you find the view pane too small, you can resize the pane, enlarge the whole window, or double-click the message in the message list to have it open in a new window. To change the size of a pane, drag on the divider between the two panes. </para>
    <para>As with folders, you can right-click messages in the message list and get a menu of possible actions, including moving or deleting them, creating filters or vFolders based on them, and marking them as junk mail.</para>
    <para>Most of the e-mail-related actions you want to perform are listed in the Actions menu in the menu bar. The most frequently used ones, like Reply and Forward, also appear as buttons in the toolbar. Most of them are also located in the right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts.</para>

    <para>To begin using the calendar, click Calendar in the shortcut bar. By default, the calendar shows today&apos;s schedule on a ruled background.

    <title>Using the Contacts Tool</title>
    <para>The Evolution contacts tool can handle all of the functions of an address book or phone book. However, it&rsquo;s easier to update Evolution than it is to change an actual paper book, in part because Evolution can synchronize with Palm OS devices and use <link linkend="ldap">LDAP</link> directories on a network.</para>
    <para>Another advantage of the Evolution contacts tool is its integration with the rest of the application. For example, you can right-click on an e-mail address in Evolution mail to create a contact entry instantly.</para>
    <para>To use the contacts tool, click Contacts in the shortcut bar. By default, the display shows all your contacts in alphabetical order, in a <link linkend="minicard">minicard</link> view.

   <para>If you are not already viewing mail, switch to the mail tool by clicking Mail in the shortcut bar. To read a message, select it in the message list; if you&apos;d like to see it in its own window, either double-click it, press Enter, or press Ctrl+O.</para>
   <tip>
    <para>To read mail with the keyboard, you can click the Spacebar to page down while you&rsquo;re reading an e-mail, and press Backspace to page up in an e-mail. </para>

    <title>Sorting the Message List</title>
    <para>Evolution helps you work by letting you sort your e-mail. To sort by sender, subject, or date, click on the bars with those labels at the top of the message list. The direction of the arrow next to the label indicates the direction of the sort. Click again, to sort them in reverse order. For example, click Date to sort messages by date from oldest to newest. Click again, and Evolution sorts the list from newest to oldest. You can also right-click the message header bars to get a set of sorting options, and to add or remove columns from the message list.

    <para>When you press Delete or click the Trash button, your mail isn&rsquo;t actually deleted, but is marked for deletion. Your e-mail is recoverable until you have expunged your mail.

    <para>The trash is actually a vFolder.Both local and IMAP Trash folders are actually vFolders that display all messages you have marked for later deletion. For more information about vFolders, see <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vfolders">Using vFolders</link>. Because emptying your trash expunges the messages in your Trash folder, emptying Trash is the same as expunging deleted mail from all your folders.</para>
    <para>This is not, however, true for the Trash folder on Exchange servers, which behaves just the same as it does in Outlook, it is a normal folder with actual messages in it.</para>

     <title>Inline Images in HTML Mail</title>
     <para>When someone sends you HTML mail that includes an image in the body of the message (for example, the welcome message in your Inbox), Evolution displays the image inside the message. You can create messages like this by using the Insert Image tool in the message composer. Alternately, just drag an image into the message composition area.</para>
     <para>Some images are links in a message, rather than being part of the message. Evolution can download those images from the Internet, but does not do so unless you request it specifically.

    <title>Unicode, ASCII, and Non-Latin Alphabets</title>
    <para>If you want to write in a non-Latin alphabet while using a Latin keyboard, try selecting a different input method in the message composer. Right-click in the message composition area and select from the Input Methods menu, then begin typing. The actual keys vary by language and input style. For example, the Cyrillic input method uses transliterated Latin keyboard combinations to get the Cyrillic alphabet, combining letters where necessary. &ldquo;Zh&rdquo; and &ldquo;ya&rdquo; produce the appropriate single Cyrillic letters, and the single-quote (&lsquo;) produces a soft-sign character.</para>
    <para>For greater language display capabilities, click Tools &gt; Settings, then select the character set choices in the Mail Preferences and Composer Preferences sections. If you aren&apos;t sure which one to use, select UTF-8, which offers the greatest range of character displays for the greatest range of languages.</para>

    <section id="bsfnqkj">
     <title>Using Character Sets</title>
     <para>A character set is a computer&apos;s version of an alphabet. In the past, the ASCII character set was used almost universally. However, it contains only 128 characters, meaning it is unable to display characters in Cyrillic, Kanjii, or other non-Latin alphabets. To work around language display problems, programmers developed a variety of methods, so many human languages now have their own specific character sets, and items written in other character sets display incorrectly. Eventually, standards organizations developed the Unicode character set UTF-8 to provide a single compatible set of codes for everyone.</para>
     <para>Most e-mail messages state in advance which character set they use, so Evolution usually knows what to display for a given binary number. However, if you find that messages are displayed as rows of incomprehensible characters, try selecting a different character set in the mail settings screen. If your recipients can&apos;t read your messages, try selecting a different character set in the composer options dialog. For some languages, such as Turkish or Korean, it might work best for you to select the language-specific character set. However, the best choice for most users is UTF-8, which offers the widest range of characters for the widest range of languages.</para>

    <title>Specifying Extra Recipients for E-Mail</title>
    <para>Evolution, like most e-mail programs, recognizes three types of addressee: primary recipients, secondary recipients, and hidden (blind) recipients. The simplest way to direct a message is to put the e-mail address or addresses in the To: field, which denotes primary recipients. Use the Cc: field to send a message to secondary recipients.</para>
    <para>Addresses on the Bcc: list are hidden from the other recipients of the message. You can use it to send mail to large groups of people, especially if they don&rsquo;t know each other or if privacy is a concern. If your Bcc: field is absent, click View Bcc Field. </para>
    <para>If you frequently write e-mail to the same groups of people, you can create address lists in the contacts tool, and then send them mail as though they have a single address.

  <section id="encryption">
   <title>Encryption</title>
   <para>Evolution helps you protect your privacy by using GNU Privacy Guard (GPG), an implementation of strong <link linkend="public-key-encryption">Public Key Encryption.</link></para>
   <para>GPG uses two keys: public and private. You can give your public key to anyone you want to receive encrypted messages, or put it on a public key server so that people can look it up before contacting you. Your private key lets you decrypt any message encrypted with your public key. Never give your private key to anyone. </para>
   <para>Using encryption takes a bit of forethought. When you send a message that is encrypted, you must encrypt it using your intended recipient&apos;s public key. To receive an encrypted message, you must make sure that the sender has your public key in advance. For signing messages, you encrypt the signature with your private key, so only your public key can unlock it. When you send the message, the recipient gets your public key and unlocks the signature, verifying your identity.</para>
   <para>You can use encryption in two different ways:</para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>You can encrypt the entire message, so that nobody but the recipient can read it.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>You can attach an encrypted signature to a plain text message, so that the recipient can read the message without decrypting it, and only needs decrypting to verify the sender&rsquo;s identity.</para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>For example, suppose that Kevin wants to send an encrypted message to his friend Rachel. He looks up her public key on a general key server, and then tells Evolution to encrypt the message. The message now reads "@#$23ui7yr87#@!48970fsd." When the information gets to Rachel, she decrypts it using her private key, and it appears as plain text for her to read.</para>

    <title>S/MIME Encryption</title>
    <para>S/MIME encryption also uses a key-based approach, but it has some significant advantages in convenience and security. S/MIME uses certificates, which are similar to keys. The public portion of each certificate is held by the sender of a message and by one of several certificate authorities, who are paid to guarantee the identity of the sender and the security of the message. Evolution already recognizes a large number of certificate authorities, so when you get a message with an S/MIME certificate, your system automatically receives the public portion of the certificate and decrypts or verifies the message.</para>
    <para>S/MIME is used most often in corporate settings. In these cases, administrators supply certificates that they have purchased from a certificate authority. In some cases, an organization can act as its own certificate authority, with or without a guarantee from a dedicated authority such as Verisign or Thawte. In either case, the system administrator provides you with a certificate file.</para>
    <para>If you want to use S/MIME independently, you can extract an identification certificate from your Mozilla or Netscape Web browser. See the Mozilla help for more information on security certificates.</para>
    <para>The certificate file is a password-protected file on your computer. To use it in Evolution:</para>
    <procedure>

If you create subfolders in your Inbox folder, you lose the ability to read messages that exist in your Inbox until you move the folders out of the way.</para>

   <title>Stopping Junk Mail (Spam)</title>
   <para>Evolution can check for junk mail for you. When the software detects mail that appears to be junk mail, it will flag it and hide it from your view. Messages that are flagged as junk mail are displayed only in the Junk folder.</para>
   <para>The junk mail filter can learn which kinds of mail are legitimate and which are not if you train it. When you first start using junk mail blocking, check the Junk folder to be sure that legitimate mail doesn&apos;t get flagged as junk mail. If good mail, also known as ham, is incorrectly flagged, remove it from the Junk folder by right-clicking it and selecting Mark as Not Junk. If Evolution misses junk mail, right-click the message, then click Mark as Junk. When you correct it, the filter will be able to recognize similar messages in the future, and will become more accurate as time goes on.</para>
   <para>To change your junk mail filtering preferences, click Tools &gt; Settings, then click Mail Preferences. In the mail preferences tool, click the Junk tab. Here, you have a couple of options: </para>
   <formalpara id="bsaz9zd">
    <title>Checking Incoming Mail for Junk: </title>
    <para>This option turns automatic junk mail filtering on or off.</para>
   </formalpara>
   <formalpara id="bsaza5z">
    <title>Include Remote Tests: </title>
    <para>This option uses tests that require a network connection, such as checking to see if a message is in a list of known junk messages, or if the sender or gateway are blacklisted by anti-spam organizations. Remote tests add to the amount of time it takes to check for junk mail, but increase accuracy.</para>

   <title>Create Rules to Automatically Organize Mail</title>
   <para>Filters work very much like the mail room in a large company. Their purpose is to bundle, sort, and distribute mail to the various folders. In addition, you can have multiple filters performing multiple actions that might effect the same message in several ways. For example, your filters could put copies of one message into multiple folders, or keep one copy and send one to another person, and it can do that quickly.</para>

  <section id="usage-mail-organize-vfolders">
   <title>Using vFolders</title>
   <para>If filters aren&rsquo;t flexible enough for you, or you find yourself performing the same search again and again, consider a vFolder. vFolders, or virtual folders, are an advanced way of viewing your e-mail messages within Evolution. If you get a lot of mail or often forget where you put messages, vFolders can help you keep things organized.</para>
   <para>A vFolder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you set it up like a filter. In other words, a conventional folder actually contains messages, but a vFolder is a view of messages that might be in several different folders. The messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of criteria you choose in advance.</para>
   <para>As messages that meet the vFolder criteria arrive or are deleted, Evolution automatically adjusts the vFolder contents. When you delete a message, it is erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as any vFolders that display it.</para>
   <para>The Unmatched vFolder is the opposite of other vFolders: it displays all messages that do not appear in other vFolders.</para>
   <para>If you use remote e-mail storage like IMAP or Microsoft Exchange, and have created vFolders to search through them, the Unmatched vFolder also searches the remote folders. If you do not create any vFolders that search remote mail stores, the Unmatched vFolder does not search in them either.</para>
   <para>As an example of using folders, searches, and vFolders, consider the following example: To organize his mailbox, Jim sets up a virtual folder for e-mails from his friend and co-worker Anna. He has another vFolder for messages that have novell.com in the address and Evolution in the subject line, so he can keep a record of what people from work send him about Evolution. If Anna sends him a message about anything other than Evolution, it only shows up in the &ldquo;Anna&rdquo; vFolder. When Anna sends him mail about the user interface for Evolution, he can see the message both in the &ldquo;Anna&rdquo; vFolder and in the &ldquo;Internal Evolution Discussion&rdquo; vFolder. </para>

   <title>The Contact Editor</title>
   <para>If you want to add or change cards, you&apos;ll use the contact editor. To change a card that already exists, double-click it to open the contact editor window.

    <para>Contains basic contact information.</para>

   <para>You can also use Actions menu to find Forward Contact, which opens a new message with the card already attached, and Send Message to Contact, which will opens a new message to the contact&apos;s e-mail address.</para>
   <para>From the Contact Editor toolbar, you can save and close, print, close, or delete the contact.</para>
   <para>You can add cards from within an e-mail message or calendar appointment. While looking at an e-mail, right-click any e-mail address or message, and click Create Card for this Address or Create Card for this Sender from the menu.</para>
   <para>Most of the items in the contact editor simply display the information you enter, but some of them have additional features:</para>
   <formalpara id="bsb02hn">
    <title>Full Name: </title>
    <para>Specify the name of your contact here. You can type a name into the Full Name field, but you can also click the Full Name button to bring up a small dialog box with text boxes for first and last names, titles like &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Her Excellency,&rdquo; and suffixes like &ldquo;Jr.&rdquo; The Full Name field also interacts with the File Under box to help you organize your contacts and to handle multi-word surnames.To see how it works, type a name in the Full Name field. As an example, we&rsquo;ll use Miguel de Icaza. You&rsquo;ll notice that the File Under field also fills in, but in reverse: Icaza, Miguel de. If you had entered John Q. Doe, the contacts editor would have correctly guessed that the entry should be filed under &ldquo;Doe, John Q.&rdquo; However, Miguel&rsquo;s surname, &ldquo;de Icaza&rdquo;, has two words, and to sort it correctly you must enter de Icaza, Miguel in the File As entry.</para>

  <section id="usage-contact-organize">
   <title>Organizing your Contacts</title>
   <para>Just as you can search mail, you can search contacts. You can also create several individual address books, or contact groups. Within a given contact group, you can have several categories of contacts. </para>

   <section id="usage-contact-organize-group">
    <title>Contacts Groups</title>
    <para>The simplest way to organize contacts is to create additional groups of contacts. You can create a new one by clicking File &gt; New &gt; Contacts Group. For contacts groups on your computer, you only need to provide a name. For contacts on the network, you need to provide more information about the contacts server you are trying to access. </para>
    <para>To move a card from one group to another, just drag it from the main display of contacts. You cannot change the contents of most network contact groups. </para>
    <note>
     <para>Contacts groups are not the same as contact lists. A contact group is like a folder or address book full of contacts. A contact list is a single contact that contains other contacts, and is most often used to e-mail several people at once.</para>
    </note>
   </section>

   <section id="usage-contact-organize-group-list">
    <title>Creating a List of Contacts</title>
    <para>A contact list is a set of contacts with a single nickname that you create. When you send e-mail to the nickname, it is sent to every member of the list. This differs from a network mailing list in that it exists only on your computer as a convenience to you, rather than as an actual e-mail address managed by a mailing list application on a server.</para>
    <para>For example, you could create one card for each family member, then add those cards to a contact list called &ldquo;Family&rdquo;. Then, instead of entering each person&apos;s e-mail address individually, you can send e-mail to &ldquo;Family&rdquo; and the message would go to all of them.</para>
    <para> To create a list of contacts: </para>
    <procedure>
     <step id="bshlf6r">
      <para>Open the list creation dialog box by clicking the New List button or click File &gt; New &gt; Contact List.</para>
     </step>
     <step id="bshlfal">
      <para>Specify a name for the list.</para>
     </step>
     <step id="bshlfcp">
      <para>Specify the names or e-mail addresses of contacts, or just drag contacts from the main window into the list.</para>
     </step>
     <step id="bshlfem">
      <para>Choose whether you want to hide the e-mail addresses when you send a message to the list. Unless it is a very small list, it is recommended that you leave the addresses hidden. This is the same thing as using the &ldquo;Bcc:&rdquo; feature discussed in <link linkend="usage-mail-getnsend-send-to-types">Specifying Extra Recipients for E-Mail</link>.</para>

     <step id="bshlfgv">
      <para>When you are finished, click OK. </para>
     </step>
    </procedure>
    <para>The list appears as a contact card, which you can use as you would any other. That includes e-mailing the list to another person, and sending e-mail to the list.</para>
    <para>To mail the list, open a new e-mail and type the name you chose for the list. Evolution will address the message to the entire list when you send it. You can also right-click on the list&rsquo;s address card in the contacts tool and select Send Message to List.</para>
    <para>Evolution cannot store contact lists on Microsoft Exchange servers.</para>
   </section>

   <section id="usage-contact-organize-group-category">
    <title>Grouping with Categories</title>
    <para>Anther way to group cards is to mark them as belonging to different categories. You can mark a card as being in several categories or no category at all. For example, you put a friend&apos;s card in the &ldquo;Business&rdquo; category because he works with you, the &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; category because he&apos;s a friend, and the &ldquo;Frequent&rdquo; category because you call him often.</para>
    <para>To mark a card as belonging to a category, click the Categories button at the lower right. In the dialog box that appears, you can check as many or as few categories as you like.</para>
    <para>If the master list of categories doesn&rsquo;t suit you, you can add your own categories. Just specify the new category&apos;s name in the text box, then click Categories and select Edit Master Category List in the window that appears. </para>

   <para>To learn how to add a remote directory to your available contact folders, see <link linkend="config-prefs-contact">Directory Servers</link>.

     <para>Network folders are only available when you are connected to the network. If you use a laptop or have a modem connection, you might want to copy or cache some of the network directory. You do this by dragging and dropping your desired contacts into the local contacts list.</para>

     <para>To prevent excess network traffic, Evolution does not normally load data from the LDAP server immediately upon opening. You must click Display All before contacts are loaded from the network. You can change this behavior in the Contact Preferences window.</para>

    <listitem>
     <para>Depending on your server settings, you might not be able to edit all the fields in a contact stored on an LDAP server.

If you want to invite additional people to a meeting without changing the organizer, it&rsquo;s best to forward the first organizer&rsquo;s message to the additional participants.</para>

    <para>In addition to the standard meeting scheduling tools, you can use the Free/Busy view to check whether people are available in advance. The Free/Busy feature is normally a function of dedicated groupware servers such as Exchange and Groupwise. However, you can also publish Free/Busy information online, and access Free/Busy information published elsewhere.
