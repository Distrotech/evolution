    <title>The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange</title>
    <para>
    The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange allows Ximian
    Evolution clients to access accounts on Microsoft Exchange 2000
    servers. It is available through Ximian Red Carpet in its own
    channel, but cannot be used without a license file.  The license
    file may be purchased from the Ximian online store at <ulink
    url="http://store.ximian.com">store.ximian.com</ulink>. Unlike the
    regular Ximian Evolution client, the Ximian Connector for
    Microsoft Exchange is proprietary software and source code is not
    available.
    </para>
   
  <warning id="licensing">
    <title>Requirements</title>
    <para>
      Ximian Connector works only with Exchange 2000, and requires
      that Outlook Web Access be enabled. Each user will need a
      valid Microsoft Exchange 2000 server account, including license.

       Software</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.  Subscribe to the Ximian
       Connector for Microsoft Exchange channel, select the Ximian
       Connector for Microsoft
       Exchange2000, and click the
       <guibutton>Install</guibutton> button.  You can also install

   <para>
       Once you have installed the software, you will also need to
       install a license file.  The license file is the verification
       that you have paid for a license to use the Ximian
       Connector. You can get the license file from the the Ximian
       online store at <ulink
       url="http://store.ximian.com">store.ximian.com</ulink>.  You
       will need a browser with strong (128-bit or greater) encryption
       to access the store. When you purchase a Ximian Connector
       license, the store will mail you the license file with
       instructions for installation. Once installed, the license file
       unlocks the Ximian Connector functionality and you may connect

    <title>Accessing the Exchange Server</title>
    <para>
      Like IMAP and LDAP data, information for
      Exchange accounts is stored on the
      server, not on your desktop computer.  This means that you can
      access it from multiple locations. It also means that your
      Microsoft Exchange account information
      is in a separate folder tree from the <guilabel>Local</guilabel>
      tree in your folder bar. You'll see it below the local tree,
      with the name you gave the account. If you have multiple
      accounts, you will have multiple folder trees.
    </para>
    <para>
      Click on any of the folder tree items to visit them; you may
      have to enter your server password.  You can now create contact
      cards, send and receive email as you would normally. If there
      are items in your local calendar or addressbook that you'd like
      to add to your Exchange stores, you
      can copy and paste them over, or just drag items from one folder
      to another as you would with two local stores.

          If you are using both an Exchange account and a local mail
          account, you should be aware that whenever you save an email
          address or appointment from an email message, it will be
          saved in your Exchange contacts list or calendar, rather
          than in your local account. The same is true of
          synchronization with Palm-OS devices: tasks, appointments,
          and addresses from your Palm-OS device will be synchronized
          with those in the Exchange folders rather than local
          folders.
