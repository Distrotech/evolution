      Even if you only get a few email messages a day, you probably
      want to sort and organize them.  When you get a hundred a day
      and you want to refer to a message you received six weeks ago,
      you <emphasis>need</emphasis> to sort and organize them.
      Fortunately, Ximian Evolution has the tools
      to help you do it.

        <para>
          One way to make sure you don't forget about a message is

        select one or more messages, and then right-click on one and select

        and allow you to set the type of flag and the due date.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <guilabel>Flag</guilabel> itself is the action you
        want to remind yourself about. Several are provided for you, such as
        <guilabel>Call</guilabel>, <guilabel>Forward</guilabel>, and
        <guilabel>Reply</guilabel>, but you can enter your own note or

        as well, if you wish.

      <para>
        Once you have added a flag, you can mark it as complete or

         When you read a flagged message, its flag status will be

      <para>
        Flags can help you organize your work in a number of ways. For
        example, you might add a <interface>Flag Status</interface> column to your message
        list and sort that way. Alternately, you could create a vFolder
        that displays all your flagged messages, and clear the flags
        when you're done, so the vFolder contains only messages with
        upcoming deadlines.

      <title>Stopping Junk Mail (Spam)</title>
      <para>
        Evolution can check for junk mail for you. When the software
        detects mail that appears to be junk mail, it will flag it and
        hide it from your view. Messages that are flagged as junk mail
        are displayed only in the <guilabel>Junk</guilabel> folder.
      </para>
      <para>
        The junk mail filter can "learn" which kinds of mail are
        legitimate and which are not if you train it. When you first
        start using junk mail blocking, check the
        <guilabel>Junk</guilabel> folder
        to be sure that legitimate mail doesn't get flagged as junk
        mail. If good mail, also known as "ham," is mis-flagged, remove
        it from the <guilabel>Junk</guilabel> folder by right-clicking
        on it and selecting <guilabel>Mark as Not Junk</guilabel>. If
        Evolution misses junk mail, right-click it and select
        <guilabel>Mark as Junk</guilabel>. When you correct it, the
        filter will be able to recognize similar messages in the future,
        and will become more accurate as time goes on.

        Using the daemon can improve filtering speed, but the daemon
        must already be running. Starting a daemon normally requires

        depending on your OS and configuration.

	Filters work very much like the mail room in a large company.
	Their purpose is to bundle, sort, and distribute mail to the
	various folders.  In addition, you can have multiple filters
	performing multiple actions that may effect the same message
	in several ways.  For example, your filters could put copies
	of one message into multiple folders, or keep a copy and send
	one to another person as well, and it can do that quickly. Of
	course, it's also faster and more flexible than an actual
	person with a pile of envelopes.

      <title>Getting Really Organized with vFolders</title>
      <para>
	If filters aren't flexible enough for you, or you find
	yourself performing the same search again and again, consider
	a vFolder. vFolders, or virtual folders, are an advanced way
	of viewing your email messages within
	Ximian Evolution.  If you get a lot of
	mail or often forget where you put messages, vFolders
	can help you stay on top of things.
      </para>
      <para>
	A vFolder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational
	tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you
	set it up like a filter.  In other words, while a conventional
	folder actually contains messages, a vFolder is a view of
	messages that may be in several different folders.  The
	messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of
	criteria you choose in advance.
      </para>

      <para>
	As messages that meet the vFolder criteria arrive or are
	deleted, Evolution will automatically adjust the vFolder
        contents.  When you delete a message, it gets erased from the
        folder in which it actually exists, as well as any vFolders
        that display it.
      </para>

      <para>
	Imagine a business trying to keep track of mail from hundreds
	of vendors and clients, or a university with overlapping and
	changing groups of faculty, staff, administrators and
	students.  The more mail you need to organize, the less you
	can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an
	organizational system that's not flexible enough.  vFolders
	make for better organization because they can accept
	overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing
	systems can't.
      </para>


    <note id="unmatched-vfolder">
      <title>The "Unmatched" vFolder</title>

        The Unmatched vFolder is the opposite of the others: it

        If you use remote email storage like IMAP or Microsoft
        Exchange, and have created vFolders to search through them,
        the Unmatched vFolder will follow your lead, and search the
        remote folders as well. If you do not create any vFolders that
        search in remote mail stores, the Unmatched vFolder will not
        search in them either.

	the "Anna" vFolder and in the "Internal Evolution Discussion"
