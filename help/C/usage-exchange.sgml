  <title>The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange</title>
  <para>
    The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange allows Ximian
    Evolution clients to access accounts on Microsoft Exchange 2000
    servers. It is available for a fee from the Ximian online store at
    <ulink
    url="http://store.ximian.com">store.ximian.com</ulink>. Unlike the
    regular Ximian Evolution client, it is proprietary software and
    source code is not available.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Ximian Connector offers a significant price advantage over
    other Exchange access methods for Linux and UNIX systems:

             The purchase of a second computer for each client imposes
             a very heavy expense burden and is exceptionally
             inconvenient.

	<listitem>
	  <para>
             Installation of multiple operating systems in a dual boot
             or virtual machine configuration (such as VMWare) can
             place a very heavy burden on the hardware and increases
             licensing costs.  Users often complain that such a system
             is inconvenient, slow, and not integrated with the rest
             of their operating system.

            Outlook Web Access is a web interface for Exchange
            servers, but works best in Microsoft Internet Explorer, is
            not integrated with the rest of the host operating system,
            and offers only limited groupware functionality.

   The Ximian Connector offers a low cost, fully integrated, option

   networks. This chapter will explain how to install, configure, and
   use it.

       To install the Ximian Connector, run Ximian Red Carpet by
       selecting
       <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu><guimenuitem>Get
       Software</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.  Subscribe to the Ximian GNOME channel,
       select the Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange 2000, and
       click the <guibutton>Install</guibutton> button.  You can also
       install the Connector by downloading the individual packages
       from ftp.ximian.com if you wish. 
   </para>
   <para>
       Once you have installed the software, you will also need to
       install a license file.  The license file is the verification
       that you have paid for a license to use the Ximian
       Connector. You can get the license file from the the Ximian
       online store at <ulink
       url="http://store.ximian.com">store.ximian.com</ulink>.  You
       will need a browser with strong (128-bit or greater) encryption
       to access the store. When you purchase a Ximian Connector
       license, the store will mail you the license file with
       instructions for installation. Once installed, the license file
       unlocks the Ximian Connector functionality and you may connect
       to an Exchange server.

    <para>
       Like IMAP and LDAP data, information for Exchange accounts is
       stored on the server, not on your desktop computer.  This means
       that you can access it from multiple locations. It also means
       that your Microsoft Exchange account information is in a
       seperate folder tree from the <guilabel>Local</guilabel> tree
       in your folder bar. You'll see it below the local tree, with
       the name you gave the account. If you have multiple accounts,
       you will have multiple folder trees.
    </para>
    <para>
       Click on any of the folder tree items to visit them; you may
       have to enter your server password.  You can now create contact
       cards, send and receive email as you would normally. If there
       are items in your local calendar or addressbook that you'd like
       to add to your Exchange stores, you can copy and paste them
       over, or just drag items from one folder to another as you
       would with two local stores.
    </para>

       In addition, when you schedule a meeting with your calendar on
       the Exchange server, you can check when other local Exchange
       users are busy according to their Exchange calendars. To do so:
