  <title>The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange</title>
  <para>
    The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange allows Ximian
    Evolution clients to access accounts on Microsoft Exchange 2000
    servers. It is available for a fee from the Ximian online store at
    <ulink
    url="http://store.ximian.com">store.ximian.com</ulink>. Unlike the
    regular Ximian Evolution client, it is proprietary software and
    source code is not available.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Ximian Connector offers a significant price advantage over
    other Exchange access methods for Linux and UNIX systems:

             The purchase of a second computer for each client imposes
             a very heavy expense burden and is exceptionally
             inconvenient.

             Installation of multiple operating systems in a dual boot
             or virtual machine configuration (such as VMWare) can
             place a very heavy burden on the hardware and increases
             licensing costs.  Users often complain that such a system
             is inconvenient, slow, and not integrated with the rest
             of their operating system.

            Outlook Web Access is a web interface for Exchange
            servers, but works best in Microsoft Internet Explorer, is
            not integrated with the rest of the host operating system,
            and offers only limited groupware functionality.

   The Ximian Connector offers a low cost, fully integrated, option

   networks. This chapter will explain how to install, configure, and
   use it.

    <title>Installing the Connector</title>
    <para>
       To install the Ximian Connector, first visit the Ximian online
       store at <ulink
       url="http://store.ximian.com">store.ximian.com</ulink>.  You
       will need a browser with strong (128-bit or greater) encryption
       to access the store. After purchase you will be given an
       activation key which you can enter into Ximian Red Carpet,
       which will download and install the software for you.

      Once you have installed the Connector, you need to set up access

      from any mail view.  If you have an existing account, and want
      to convert it to use for Exchange, do the following:

    <title>Accessing the Exchange Server</title>
    <para>
       Like IMAP and LDAP data, information for Exchange accounts is
       stored on the server, not on your desktop computer.  This means
       that you can access it from multiple locations. It also means
       that your Microsoft Exchange account information is in a
       seperate folder tree from the <guilabel>Local</guilabel> tree
       in your folder bar. You'll see it below the local tree, with
       the name you gave the account. If you have multiple accounts,
       you will have multiple folder trees.
    </para>
    <para>
       Click on any of the folder tree items to visit them; you may
       have to enter your server password.  You can now create contact
       cards, send and receive email as you would normally. If there
       are items in your local calendar or addressbook that you'd like
       to add to your Exchange stores, you can copy and paste them
       over, or just drag items from one folder to another as you
       would with two local stores.
    </para>
    <para>
       In addition, when you schedule a meeting with your calendar on
       the Exchange server, you can check when other local Exchange
       users are busy according to their Exchange calendars. To do so: 
       <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
	<listitem>
	  <para>
            Open a new appointment in the calendar.
