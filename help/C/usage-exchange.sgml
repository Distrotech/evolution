  <title>The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange</title>
  <para>
    The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange allows Ximian
    Evolution clients to access accounts on Microsoft Exchange 2000
    servers. It is available through Ximian Red Carpet in its own
    channel, but cannot be used without a license file.  The license
    file may be purchased from the Ximian online store at <ulink
    url="http://store.ximian.com">store.ximian.com</ulink>. Unlike the
    regular Ximian Evolution client, the Ximian Connector for
    Microsoft Exchange is proprietary software and source code is not
    available.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Ximian Connector offers a significant price advantage over
    other Exchange access methods for Linux and UNIX systems:

	  <para>
             The purchase of a second computer for each client imposes
             a very heavy expense burden and is exceptionally
             inconvenient.

	<term>Dual Boot or Virtual Machine:</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
             Installation of multiple operating systems in a dual boot
             or virtual machine configuration (such as VMWare) also
             increases licensing and administration costs.  Users
             often complain that such a system is inconvenient, slow,
             and not integrated with the rest of their operating
             system.

            Outlook Web Access is a web interface for Exchange
            servers, but works best in Microsoft Internet Explorer.
            Outlook Web Access also is
            not integrated with the rest of the host operating system
            and offers only limited groupware functionality.

   The Ximian Connector offers a low cost, fully integrated, option
   for Exchange 2000 server access in heterogeneous client
   networks. This chapter will explain how to install, configure, and

       Connector for Microsoft Exchange channel, select the Ximian
       Connector for Microsoft
       <application>Exchange</application>2000, and click the
       <guibutton>Install</guibutton> button.  You can also install

       Once you have installed the software, you will also need to
       install a license file.  The license file is the verification
       that you have paid for a license to use the Ximian
       Connector. You can get the license file from the the Ximian
       online store at <ulink
       url="http://store.ximian.com">store.ximian.com</ulink>.  You
       will need a browser with strong (128-bit or greater) encryption
       to access the store. When you purchase a Ximian Connector
       license, the store will mail you the license file with
       instructions for installation. Once installed, the license file
       unlocks the Ximian Connector functionality and you may connect

    <para>
      Like IMAP and LDAP data, information for <application>Exchange</application>accounts is
      stored on the server, not on your desktop computer.  This means
      that you can access it from multiple locations. It also means
      that your Microsoft <application>Exchange</application>account information is in a
      seperate folder tree from the <guilabel>Local</guilabel> tree
      in your folder bar. You'll see it below the local tree, with
      the name you gave the account. If you have multiple accounts,
      you will have multiple folder trees.
    </para>
    <para>
      Click on any of the folder tree items to visit them; you may
      have to enter your server password.  You can now create contact
      cards, send and receive email as you would normally. If there
      are items in your local calendar or addressbook that you'd like
      to add to your <application>Exchange</application>stores, you can copy and paste them
      over, or just drag items from one folder to another as you
      would with two local stores.

      In addition, when you schedule a meeting with your calendar on
