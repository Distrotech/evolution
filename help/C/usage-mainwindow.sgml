    <title>The First Time you Start Evolution</title>

      Start <application>Evolution</application> by selecting
      <guimenuitem>Evolution</guimenuitem> from your
      <guimenu>Programs</guimenu> menu, or by typing
      <command>evolution</command> at the command line.  The first
      time you run the program, it will create a directory called
      <filename>evolution</filename> in your home directory, where it
      will keep all your <application>Evolution</application>-related
      files. Then, it will offer to help you set up mail accounts and
      import data from other applications.

    <para>
      The first screen welcomes you to the assistant.  It is estimated that
      configuring your mail will take 2 to 5 minutes and importing mail will
      take 1 to 2 minutes.

        However, <application>Evolution</application> has some
        important differences.  First, it's built to handle very large
        amounts of mail.  Both the <link

        <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link>
        functions were built for speed and efficiency on large volumes
        of mail. There's also the <application>Evolution</application>
        <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">vFolder</link>,
        an advanced organizational feature not found in mainstream
        mail clients.  If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep every
        message you get in case you need to refer to it later, you'll
        find this feature especially useful.

        Here's what the mailer looks like:

     If you find the <interface>view pane</interface> too small, you can resize
        the pane, enlarge the whole window, or double-click on the
        message in the <interface>message list</interface> to have it
        open in a new window.  To change the sizes of a pane, just click
        and hold on the divider between the two panes.  Then you can drag
        up and down to select the size of the panes.  Just like with
        folders, you can right-click on messages in the message list and
        get a menu of possible actions.
      </para>
      <para>
        Most of the mail-related actions you'll want to perform are
        listed in the <guimenu>Message</guimenu> menu in the menu bar.
        The most frequently used ones, like
        <guimenuitem>Reply</guimenuitem> and
        <guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem>, also appear as buttons in
        the toolbar. Almost all of them are also located in the
        right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts, which tend to be
        faster once you get the hang of them.  You can choose
        whichever way you like best; the idea is that the software
        should work the way you want, rather than making you work the
        way the it does.

      <title>Introducing the Address Book</title>
      <para>
        The <application>Evolution</application> address book can
        handle all of the functions of an address book, phone book, or
        Rolodex.  Of course, it's a lot easier to update
        <application>Evolution</application> than it is to change an
        actual paper book. <application>Evolution</application> also
        allows easy synchronization with hand-held devices.  Since
        <application>Evolution</application> supports the <glossterm

        use it with almost any type of existing directory server on
        your network.

      <para>
        Another advantage of the <application>Evolution</application>
        address book is its integration with the rest of the

        an email just by right-clicking on the sender's email address.
      </para>
      <para>
        To open your address book, click on

        one of your contacts folders from the folder bar.  <xref
        linkend="usage-contact-fig"> shows the address book in all its

        your cards in alphabetical order, in a <glossterm

        other views from the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu, and adjust
