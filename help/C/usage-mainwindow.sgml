     Start <application>Evolution</application> by selecting
     <menuchoice><guimenu>Main Panel Menu</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Applications</guisubmenu>
     <guimenuitem>Evolution</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or by typing
     <command>evolution</command> at the command line.  The first time
     you run the program, it will create a directory called
     <filename>evolution</filename> in your home directory, where it
     will keep all your <application>Evolution</application>-related
     files.
   </para>
   <para>
     After <application>Evolution</application> starts
     up, you will see the <interface>main window</interface>, with the
     <interface>Inbox</interface> open.  It should look a lot like the
     picture in <xref linkend="usage-mainwindow-fig">. On the left of
     the <interface>main window</interface> is the <interface>shortcut
     bar</interface>, with several buttons in it.  Just underneath the
     title bar is a series of menus in the <interface>menu
     bar</interface>, and below that, the <interface>tool
     bar</interface> with buttons for different functions. The largest
     part of the <interface>main window</interface> is taken up by the
     actual <interface>Inbox</interface>, where messages are listed
     and displayed.  If you're running the program for the first time,
     you'll have just one message: a welcome from Ximian.

      <title>The Way Evolution Looks</title>
      <para>
	The appearance of both <application>Evolution</application>
	and <application>GNOME</application> is very easy to
	customize, so your screen might not look like this picture.
	You might decide to have <application>Evolution</application>
	start with the calendar and a folder bar, or with the contact
	manager occupying the entire window.

    <title>The Shortcut Bar</title>
    <para>
        <application>Evolution</application>'s most important job is
        to give you access to your information and help you use it
        quickly.  One way it does that is through the
        <interface>shortcut bar</interface>, the column on the left
        hand side of the main window.  The large buttons with names
        like <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> and
        <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> are the shortcuts, and you can
        select different groups of shortcuts by clicking the
        rectangular group buttons.
    </para>
    <para>
       The shortcut group buttons are <guibutton>Evolution
       Shortcuts</guibutton> and <guibutton>Internet
       Directories</guibutton>.  When you click on them, they'll slide
       up and down to give you access to different sorts of shortcuts.
       When you first start <application>Evolution</application>, you
       are looking at the <guilabel>Evolution Shortcuts</guilabel>
       category.  If you click <guilabel>Internet
       Directories</guilabel>, it will slide up and you'll see buttons
       for the <guilabel>Bigfoot</guilabel> and
       <guilabel>Netcenter</guilabel> directories, as well as any
       others you or your system administrator may have added. You can
       add more groups by right-clicking on the background of the
       shortcut bar and selecting <guimenuitem>Menu
       Group</guimenuitem>.  Internet directories behave a lot like
       the local contact manager, which is covered in <xref
       linkend="usage-contact">.

    <para>
       Take a look at the <guilabel>Evolution Shortcuts</guilabel>

      If you don't like the shortcut bar, you can use the folder bar
      or the menu bar to navigate the main window. You can also use
      the keyboard. You can move around the window with the
      <keycap>Tab</keycap> key, and use 
            <keycombo action="simul">
                 <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> 
                 <keycap>G</keycap> 
             </keycombo>
      to go to a particular folder.  You can hide and show the folder
      bar and the shortcut bar by selecting those items in the
      <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu.  When the folder bar is hidden,
      you can use the folder location label as a drop-down menu to
      move among folders.

    <para>
      The <interface>folder bar</interface> is a more comprehensive
      way to view the information you've stored with

      appointments, address cards, and email in a tree that's a lot
      like a <glossterm linkend="filetree">file
      tree</glossterm>&mdash; it starts small at the top, and branches
      downwards. On most computers, there will be three or four
      folders at the base.  First is the <guilabel>Local</guilabel>
      folder, which holds all the <application>Evolution</application>

      Right-clicking will bring up a menu for just about anything
      in GNOME, and <application>Evolution</application> is no

      <para>
	GNOME 2.0 will support context-sensitive help, which means you
	can almost always get help on an item by right-clicking it.
	If you're not sure what something is, or don't know what you
	can do with it, choosing <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem> from
	the right-click menu is a good way to find out.

      To change the order of folders, or put one inside another, use
      drag-and-drop.  To move individual
      messages, appointments, and address cards between folders, you
      can do the same thing: drag them where you want them, and
