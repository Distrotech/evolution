  <title>The Evolution Contact Manager</title>
  <abstract>
    <para>
      The <application>Evolution</application> contact manager can
      handle all of the functions of an address book, phone book, or
      Rolodex.  Of course, <application>Evolution</application> allows
      easier updates than an actual paper book. <application>
      Evolution </application> also allows easy synchronization with
      handheld and remote devices.  Since
      <application>Evolution</application> supports most major network
      protocols, including <glossterm>LDAP</glossterm>, it's easy to
      use over an existing network.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another advantage of the <application>Evolution</application>
      address book is its integration with the rest of the
      application.  That means that when you look for someone's
      address, you can also see a history of appointments with that
      person.  Or, you can get an e-mail with contact information in
      it and create a new address card on the spot.  In addition,
      searches and folders and all work in the same way they do in the
      other components, so you don't have to learn another system for
      similar tasks.
    </para>
    <para>
      This chapter will cover using the
      <application>Evolution</application> contact manager to organize
      any amount of contact information, share addresses over a
      network, and several ways to save time with everyday tasks.  To
      learn about configuring the contact manager, see <xref
      linkend="config-prefs-contact">.

    <title>Getting Started With the Contact Manager</title>	
    
    <para>
       To open up your address book, click on
       <guibutton>Contacts</guibutton> in the shortcut bar.  The
       contact manager is illustrated in <xref
       linkend="usage-contact-fig">.  By default, the contact manager
       shows all your cards in alphabetical order, and in a
       <glossterm>minicard</glossterm> format.

    <para>
       The toolbar for the address book is quite simple:

       <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
           Press <guibutton>New</guibutton> for a new contact.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>

        </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
       The last feature is <guilabel>Quick Search</guilabel>; to use
       it, just type in the person you're looking for and hit
       <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  <application>Evolution</application>
       will search through the name fields of all the cards to find
       one that matches.  The search is currently case-sensitive.
    </para>
    <para>
       If there are no matches, the card display will be blank.  To
       display <emphasis>all</emphasis> of your contacts, you can
       leave the <guilabel>Quick Search</guilabel> field blank, and
       press enter.
    </para>
    <para>
       The rest of the contact manager is taken up by the display of
       your cards.  You can view it as a table or as a list of
       cards&mdash; switch between them in the <guimenu>View</guimenu>
       menu &mdash; and move through them alphabetically alphanumeric
       buttons and the scrollbar at the right of the window.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="usage-contact-cards">
    <title>Create, Change, and Delete Cards</title>

    <para>
       The easiest thing you can do with a card is delete it.  To
       delete a card, click on it once to select it, then press the
       <guibutton>Delete Card</guibutton> button.
    </para>

    <para>
       Any time you add new information to a card, whether it's an old
       card you're editing or a new card you're just adding to your
       address book, you'll use the contact editor.  To change a card
       that already exists, just double click it to open the contact
       editor window with all the current information already filled
       in.  If you want to create a new one, clicking the
       <guibutton>New Card</guibutton> button will open up that same
       window, but with empty fields instead of full ones.  Either
       way, it's the same tool for quite similar tasks, and you'll
       find that it's pretty flexible and can store quite a lot more
       than you'd think would fit onto a file card.

      <title>The Contact Editor</title>
      <para>
	  The contact editor window has two tabs,
    	  <guilabel>General</guilabel>, for basic contact information,
    	  and <guilabel>Details</guilabel>, for a more specific
    	  description of the person.  In addition, it contains a full

      <para> 
        The <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab contains no less
        than seven sections, each with an icon: a face, for name and
        company; a telephone for phone numbers; an envelope for email
        address; a house for postal address; a handshake for contacts
        (FIXME: I don't understand this feature, and the button
        doesn't do anything yet.); and a briefcase for categories.
        You can guess what sort of information belongs in fields like
        <guilabel>Job Title</guilabel> and <guilabel>Web page
        address</guilabel>, but there are several parts of the window
        that are a little more interesting.  </para> <para>
        <guilabel>Categories</guilabel> feature, which is discussed in
        <xref linkend="usage-contact-organize">, there are a few
        things you'll want to know about: the first of these is the
        <guilabel>Full Name</guilabel> button.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can enter a name into the <guibutton>Full Name</guibutton>
        field, or you can click the button to bring up a small dialog
        box with a few text boxes:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem> <para>
	    <guilabel>Title:</guilabel>Enter an honorific or select one from the menu.
	  </para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem> <para> <guilabel>First:</guilabel>The person's first, or given, name.
    	  </para></listitem>

	  <listitem> <para>
             <guilabel>Middle:</guilabel>The middle name or initial, if any, goes here.
          </para></listitem>

	  <listitem> <para>
	     <guilabel>Last:</guilabel>The last name (surname, family name), belongs here.
	  </para></listitem>

	  <listitem> <para>
             <guilabel>Suffix:</guilabel>Suffixes such as "Jr." or "III" can go here. 
	  </para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      
      <para>
         The <guilabel>Full Name</guilabel> field has one more trick
         up its sleeve: it interacts with the <guilabel>File
             As</guilabel> box to help you organize your contacts.  To
             see how it works, type a name in the <guilabel>Full
             Name</guilabel> field: <userinput>Eva Lucianne
             Tester</userinput>.  You'll notice that the
             <guilabel>File As</guilabel> field also fills up, but in
             reverse: <computeroutput>Tester,
             Lucianne</computeroutput>.  You can pick
         <computeroutput>Eva Tester</computeroutput> from the
             drop-down, or type in your own, such as
         <userinput>Lucianne Tester, Eva</userinput>.  I suggest that
             you don't enter something entirely different from the
             actual name, since you might forget that you've filed
             Eva's information under "F" for "Fictitious Helix Code
             Employees" </para>
    
      <para>   
        The other feature I want to mention involves the little
        squares next to several of the fields.  Click on them and
        you'll get a menu of different labels; for the fields in the
        telephone section, it's a long list involving things like
        <guilabel>Home</guilabel>, <guilabel>Home 2</guilabel>,
        <guilabel>Other Fax</guilabel>, and
        <guilabel>Pager</guilabel>.  Select from among them to
        determine which four telephone numbers to display at any given
        time.  Of course, these connected times mean that people often
        have more than four telephone numbers.  You can display only
        four in the editor, but <application>Evolution</application>
        can remember them all for you.  When you click the little
        square button for the list of labels, any that you've already
        filled in will be marked.  </para>

  <sect1 id="usage-contact-organize">
    <title>Organizing your Contact Manager</title>
    <para>
       Organizing your contact manager is a lot like organizing your
       mail.  You can have folders and searches the same way you can
       with mail, but the contact manager does not allow vFolders.  It
       does, however, allow each card to fall under several
       categories, and allow you to create your own categories.  We'll
       go over categories in a bit.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another useful UNIMPLEMENTED
      <application>Evolution</application> feature is its ability to
      recognize when people live or work together.  If several people
      in your contact manager share an address, and you change the
      address for one of them, <application>Evolution</application>
      will ask you if you wish to change the address for all of them,
      or just for one.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="usage-contact-organize-group">
      <title>Groups of contacts</title>
      <para>
         <application>Evolution</application> lets you put cards into
         folders and mark them as members of different categories.
         Although the contact manager does not support vFolders,
         categories should provide as much flexibility as you need in
         grouping your address cards.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-folder">
	<title>Grouping with Folders</title>
	<para>
	   The simplest way to group address cards is to use folders.
	   By default, cards start in the
	   <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> folder.  You can create more
	   folders inside that one, or create other address book
	   folders as well.  Each card must be in one and only one
	   folder.  If you've read <xref linkend="usage-mainwindow">
	   then you already know that you can create a new folder by
	   selecting <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu> and then
	   <guimenuitem>Folder</guimenuitem> from the
	   <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu.
	 </para>
	<para>
          To put a card into a folder, just drag it there from the
          folder view, or (SOMETHING ELSE).  Remember that address
          cards can only go in contact folders, just like mail can
          only go in mail folders, and calendars in calendar folders.
         </para>
      </sect3>
      
      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-category">
	<title>Grouping with Categories</title>
	<para>
           The other way to group cards is to mark them as belonging
           to different categories.  The difference between folders
           and categories is that folders contain cards, but category
           membership is a property of each card.  That means that you
           can mark a card as being in several categories or no
           category at all.  For example, I put my friend Matthew's
           card in the "Business" category, because he works with me,
           the "Friends" category, because he's also my friend, and
           the "Frequent" category, because I call him all the time
           and can never remember his phone number.
         </para>
	<para>
           To mark a card as belonging to a category, click the
           <guibutton>Categories</guibutton> button at the lower
           right.  A dialog box will pop up with check-boxes for
           different categories in it.  You can select as many or as
           few categories as you like.
        </para>
	<para>
           Then, you can refer to all the cards in that category by:
         </para>
	<para>
           If the master list of categories don't suit you, you can
           add your own.  Just enter the new category's name in the
           text box, then click <guibutton>Categories</guibutton>e and
           choose <guilabel>Add to Master List</guilabel> in the
           window that appears. (FIXME: This isn't quite accurate.)

  <sect1 id="usage-contact-sharing">
    <title>Sharing your Cards (and keeping them to yourself)</title>
    <para>
       Cards can be shared over a network.  This is the sort of
       feature you'll want to use if your company has a list of
       vendors and clients that needs constant updating.  If you
       also share your calendars, people can avoid duplicating
       work and keep up to date on developments within their
       workgroup or across the entire company.
    </para>

     <example id="usage-contact-sharing-ex">
	<title>Sharing Address Cards and Calendar Data</title>
	  <para>
	    Ray wants to schedule a meeting with Company X, so he
	    checks the network for the Company X address card so he
	    knows whom to call there.  Since his company also shares
	    calendars, he then learns that his co-worker Deanna has
	    already scheduled a meeting with Company X next Thursday.
	    He can either go to the meeting himself or ask Deanna to
	    discuss his concerns for him.  Either way, he avoids
	    scheduling an extra meeting with Company X.
