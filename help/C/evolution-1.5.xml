<!-- Almost every chapter is an entity.  Files, Chapter id's, and
entity names correspond.  APX is for appendix.  -->

<!-- STYLE RULES:
* Use "guilabel" instead of "guibutton" everywhere.
* "Address Book" is two words, but it's better to use "Contacts", Contact, or Contact List
* The "application" tag is not used around "Evolution."
* Filenames use  command tags so they appear in the same font as commands 
* There is one bar and it is the Shortcut Bar. The folder bar is dead. -->

      <para>
        Part one of the Ximian Evolution manual
        describes how to use Ximian Evolution for
        email, contact management, and appointment and task
        scheduling.  You'll find as you go along that there's more
        than one way to do things, and you can pick whichever method
        you like best.

  <title>Configuring and Managing Ximian Evolution</title>
    <partintro>
      <para>
        Ximian Evolution is highly
        configurable.  Usually, when developers say that, they mean
        that they didn't test it out thoroughly and have left it to
        other programmers to "configure" themselves a working
        system. In the case of Ximian
        Evolution, "configurable" means that, while you
        can expect the program to work perfectly well with the default
        settings, it's also easy to alter its behavior in a wide
        variety of ways, so that it fits your needs exactly.  This
        part of the book will describe that process, from the quickest
        glimpse of the Setup Assistant to an in-depth guide to obscure
        preferences settings.
