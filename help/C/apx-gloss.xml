    <title>Importing Contacts from Outlook</title>

    <para>
       To import contacts, you will again have to use Mozilla as an
      intermediary. This time, you will use Outlook to save your data
      to a comma separated value (CSV) file, then import it to
      Mozilla. From Mozilla, you will save it as an an LDIF file,
      which Evolution will import.

        <para>
          In Windows, export each Outlook address book as .csv. It is
          best to select the <guilabel>Export All Fields</guilabel> option,
        rather than choose a subset of fields. Be aware that if you
        have multiple address books, Outlook will suggest the same
        name for each exported file, so be sure to choose a new name
        each time you export a new address book.

Basically, the .cvs files will contain a top line with column titles
(one per record field), and as many lines as there are contact entries
(records). (Sorry, no idea about "groups" of contacts as subsets of an
address book. Can you help?)

A bit of massaging is useful, because while the Outlook set of columns is very comprehensive, other programs like Mozilla and Evolution have fewer and not entirely consistent, field names.

For example,

* Outlook offers 3 fields for email, Evolution just two, so I move the 3rd Outlook email address to the Notes field.

* Outlook offers First, Middle, Last name fields, the others just First, Last, so I add the Middle Name to the First Name field.

* Outlook offers three lines for the street address, instead of two (although the 3rd is rarely used, since most data end up in the City, State, ZIP/Postcode, Country fields).

2) Switch to Linux. Start OpenOffice.org Calc. Open all the .csv files. A dialog will let you choose the right separators.

3) Copy all records (lines) from all books (if you have multiple books) into the same file, using header lines to separate them. Thus you will massage all books in one shot. Save it.


4.1) For names, add a few columns (by header, to write in the 1st line) FIRSTNAMECALC, FIRSTNAMENEW, SPACE.

4.2) In the 1st record under SPACE insert a space; under FIRSTNAMECALC insert the formula:

=CONCATENATE([cell under FIRSTNAME];[cell under SPACE];[cell under MIDDLE NAME])

4.3) Copy these two cells all the way down to the last record. Check if first and middle names have been merged OK.

4.4) Copy the whole FIRSTNAMECALC column.

4.5) Paste-Special it over the FIRSTNAMENEW column, as "strings" - i.e. just the result, without formula.

4.6) Rename this column to FIRSTANDMIDDLE, delete the FIRSTNAMECALC, FIRTSTNAME, MIDDLENAME, SPACE columns.

If you care about those things (Continental Europe?), you may likewise concatenate more fields, as to have the FIRSTNAME column contain the whole sequence: Title First-Name Middle-Name (perhaps a space and comma) Suffix.


5.1 - 5.6) For the 3rd email: first check if some exist. If they do, repear the procedure like for the names, until the 3rd email addresses are attached to the end of the Notes field.

Likewise, depending on the data you actually have, you may want to plan to enter it into fields that may not be ideal, but at least similar.

6) Seek & delete all empty columns, so at later steps you won't risk importing lots of nothing, and leave out lots of something.

7) Save the file as many times as there are address books you want to have. Specify .csv, but select TAB as field separator and select double quote (") for text marker. 

8) Open each file, delete the excess records (lines) but KEEP THE TOP LINE where the column names are, save it as before, and finally once the file is saved, CHANGE THE FILENAME ENDING TO .tab - Mozilla likes them that way. For some reason, it won't recognize a tab-separated file that is not named in .tab, as if Calc did not mark it the file-type properly. This is not exactly Unix-like, but that's how it works. It may be a quirk of my setup, as one can instruct a filemanager to recognize filetypes from the 3-letter subfixes, like in Windows.

9) Start Mozilla, import all the first address book as "single file".

10) Carefully select which destination field (left colum) will suck up which source fields (right column). You do that by moving the destination fields. IMPORTANT: least you go nuts, start from the top and work your way down. Punch OK. Peruse the results. Don't do more imports until satisfied. Field mapping is sticky, so you'll do it only once.

11) Repeat for the other files.  (I still have some doubts: sometimes contacts end up in the main Contacts folder istead of the one I select.  I still need to investigate.  Hints anyone?)
