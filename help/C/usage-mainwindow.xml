      <title>What is Novell Evolution, and What Can It Do for Me?</title>
      <para>
        Information is useless unless it's organized and accessible;
        it's hardly even worth the name if you can't look at it and be
        <emphasis>informed</emphasis>.  The goal of
        Novell Evolution is to make the
        tasks of storing, organizing, and retrieving your personal
        information easier, so you can work and communicate with
        others.  That is, it's a highly evolved <link
        linkend="groupware">groupware</link> program, an integral
        part of the Internet-connected desktop.
      </para>
      <para>
        Novell Evolution can help you work in a group by handling
        email, address and other contact information, and one or more
        calendars.  It can do that on one or several computers,
        connected directly or over a network, for one person or for
        large groups.
      </para>

      <para>
        With Novell Evolution, you can
        accomplish your most common daily tasks faster.  For example, it
        takes only one or two clicks to enter appointment or
        contact information sent to you by email, or to send email to a contact
        or appointment.  Novell Evolution
        makes displays faster and more efficient, so searches are faster
        and memory usage is lower.  People who get lots of mail will
        appreciate advanced features like <link
        linkend="usage-mail-organize-vfolders">VFolders</link>,
        which let you save searches as though they were ordinary mail
        folders.

     The first time you run the program, it will create a directory
      called <filename>.evolution</filename> in your home directory,
      where it will store all of its local data.  Then, it will open a
      first-run assistant to help you set up mail accounts and import
      data from other applications.

    <title>The Shortcut Bar</title>
    <para>
        Novell Evolution's most important job is
        to give you access to your information and help you use it
        quickly.  One way it does that is through the
        shortcut bar, the column on the left
        hand side of the main window.  The  buttons with names
        like <guilabel>Mail</guilabel> and
        <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> are the shortcuts. Above them
        is a list of folders for the current Evolution tool.
    </para>
    <para>
      The folder list organizes your mail, calendars, contact lists,
      and task lists in a tree, similar to a <link linkend="filetree">file
      tree</link>.  Most people will find one to four 
      folders at the base of the tree, depending on the tool and their
    system configuration. Each Evolution tool will have at least one,
    called <guilabel>On This Computer</guilabel>, for local
    information. For example, the folder list for the email tool will show any
    remote mail storage you have set up, plus local folders and 
    <guilabel>vFolders</guilabel>, or virtual folders, discussed in <xref
    linkend="usage-mail-organize-vfolders"/>. 
    </para>

    <para>
       If you get large volumes of mail, you'll want more folders than
       just your Inbox; you can also create multiple calendar, task,
      or contacts folders.

      <para>
        However, Novell Evolution has some
        important differences.  First, it's built to handle very large
      amounts of mail.  The <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-spam">junk mail</link>, message <link
        linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and
        <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link>
        functions were built for speed and efficiency on large volumes
        of mail. There's also the <link
linkend="usage-mail-organize-vfolders">vFolder</link>, an advanced
        organizational feature not found in mainstream mail clients.
        If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep every message you get
        in case you need to refer to it later, you'll find this
        feature especially useful.

        it to select the size of the panes.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      Just like with folders, you can right-click on messages in the
      message list and get a menu of possible actions, including moving or deleting them, 
      creating filters or vFolders based on them, and marking them as junk mail.
    </para>
    <para>
        Most of the mail-related actions you'll want to perform are
        listed in the <guimenu>Actions</guimenu> menu in the menu bar.
        The most frequently used ones, like
        <guimenuitem>Reply</guimenuitem> and
        <guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem>, also appear as buttons in
        the toolbar. Almost all of them are also located in the
        right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts, which tend to be
        faster once you get the hang of them.  You can choose
        whichever way you like best; the idea is that the software
        should work the way you want, rather than making you work the
        way the it does.

       To begin using the calendar, click the 
       <guilabel>Calendar</guilabel> button in the shortcut
       bar.  By default, the calendar starts showing
       today's schedule on a ruled background.  At the upper right,
       there's a monthly calendar you can use to switch days.  Below
       that, there's a <guilabel>Task</guilabel> pad, where you can
       keep a list of tasks separate from your calendar appointments.

        Tasks are distinct from appointments in that they generally
        don't have times associated with them. You can see a larger
        view of your task list by clicking the
        <guilabel>Tasks</guilabel> button in the shortcut bar.

      <para>
	The month pane is a small view of a calendar month.
        To display additional months, drag the column border to
        the left. You can also select a range of days in the month
        pane to get a custom range of days displayed in the
        appointment list.

      <title>Introducing the Contacts Tool</title>
      <para>
        The Novell Evolution contacts tool
        can handle all of the functions of an address book, phone
        book, or Rolodex.  Of course, it's a lot easier to update
        Evolution than it is to change an actual paper book, in part
        because Evolution can synchronize with
        PalmOS devices and use <link
        linkend="ldap">LDAP</link> directories on a network.
      </para>
      <para>
        Another advantage of the Novell Evolution
        contacts tool is its integration with the rest of the
        application.  For example, you can right-click on an email
        address in Evolution mail to create a contact entry instantly.
      </para>
      <para>
        To use the contacts tool, click the
        <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> button in the shortcut bar.  <xref
        linkend="usage-contact-fig"/> shows the address book in all its
        organizational glory.  By default, the display shows all
        your contacts in alphabetical order, in a <link
        linkend="minicard">minicard</link> view.  You can select
        other views from the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu, and adjust
        the width of the columns by clicking and dragging the gray
        column dividers.
      </para>
      <para>
        The contacts tool looks like this:

      </para>

      <para>
        The largest section of the contacts display shows a list of individual
        contacts. You can also search through the contacts in the same way
        that you search email folders, with the search tool on the
        right side of the toolbar.
