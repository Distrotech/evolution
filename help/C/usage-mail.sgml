          Email is an integral part of life these days, and
          <application>Evolution</application> mail is here to help
          you keep track of it.  <application>Evolution</application>
          email is like other email programs in all the ways you would
          hope:

        <para>
          However, <application>Evolution</application> has some
          important differences.  First, it's built to handle very
          large amounts of mail without slowing down or crashing.  We
          had high mail volumes in mind when we designed our <link
          linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and
          <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link>
          functions.  There's also the
          <application>Evolution</application> <link
          linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">vFolder</link>, an
          advanced organizational feature not found in other mail
          clients.  If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep every
          message you get in case you need to refer to it later,
          you'll find that feature especially useful.
        </para>
        
	<para>
           You can start reading email by clicking
           <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> in the shortcut bar.  By
           default, the <interface>Inbox</interface> is open when you
           start <application>Evolution</application>, and the first
           time you see your inbox, there's a message in it from Helix
           Code welcoming you to the application.

            The first time you open your
            <application>Evolution</application>
            <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel>, you will see a window like the
            one in <xref linkend="usage-mail-intro-fig">, with a
            message from Helix Code in the<interface> message
            list</interface>.  The message is displayed
            below that, in the <interface>view pane</interface>.  If
            you find the<interface> view pane</interface> too small,
            you can double-click on the message in the
            <interface>message list</interface> to have it open in a
            new window.  As is the case with folders, you can
            right-click on messages in the message list and get a 
            menu of possible actions.
          </para>
	  <para>
            Go ahead and right-click on the message, and select
            <guimenuitem>Delete Message</guimenuitem> from the menu
            that appears.  The message will move into the
            <guilabel>Trash</guilabel> folder.  If you want to keep
            it, you can open the <guilabel>Trash</guilabel> folder
            and drag the message back to your
            <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel>.  The trash will be
            automatically emptied the next time you quit
            <application>Evolution</application>. (FEATURE

                gives me a chance to change my mind about a message
                before it goes out.  That way, I don't send anything I'll

            There is quite a bit more to sending mail, though.  In the

	  <sect3 id="usage-mail-getnsend-send-to">
	    <title>Choosing Recipients</title>
	    <para>
              If you have created address cards in the contact
	      manager, you can also enter nicknames or other portions
	      of address data, and
	      <application>Evolution</application> will complete the
	      address for you. (INSERT description of UI for this
	      feature, once it is decided upon). If you enter a name
	      or nickname that can go with more than one card,
	      Evolution will open a dialog box to ask you which person
	      you meant.  (QUESTION: will users be able to drag & drop
	      address cards to send email?).  For more information
	      about using email together with the contact manager and

	    <para>
              In addition, you can mark recipients in three different
              ways.  The <guilabel>To:</guilabel> field is for the
              primary recipients of the message you are going to send.
              However, it is considered bad form to have more than a
              few email addresses in this section.

	    <para>
              If you're writing to one person, but want to keep a
              third party up to date, you can use
              <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel>.  Hearkening back to the dark
              ages when people used typewriters and there were no copy
              machines, "Cc" stands for "Carbon Copy."  Use it
              whenever you want to share a message you've written to
              someone else.
              <example>
		<title>Using the Cc: field</title>
		<para>
                   Say, for example, Susan sends an email to a client.
                   She puts her co-worker, Tim, in the in the
                   <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> field, so that he know
                   what's going on.  The client can see that Tim also
                   recieved the message, and know that they can talk
                   to Tim about the message as well.
                </para>

	    <para>
              If you have a large number of recipients, or if you want
              to send mail to several people without sharing the
              recipient list, you should use
              <guilabel>BCc:</guilabel>. "BCc" stands for "Blind
              Carbon Copy", and means that people listed in the
              <guilabel>BCc:</guilabel> are excluded from the
              recipient list, although they will receive the message
              and the list of addresses from the
              <guilabel>To:</guilabel> and <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel>
              fields.

                 <para>
                   Let's say Tim sends an email to a client, and wants
                   his supervisor to know what he wrote.  He doesn't,
                   however, want the client to start writing his
                   supervisor about the project&mdash; it's Tim's job
                   to deal with the client.  So Tim puts his
                   supervisor's email address in the
                   <guilabel>BCc:</guilabel> field.  That way, the
                   client has one contact, and the boss stays in the
                   loop.

              If a message has several recipients, as in the case of

		<title>A Technical note on HTML Tags</title>
                <para>
		  Any text, including HTML tags, entered into the
                  message composition window is assumed to be plain
                  text.  If you enter HTML directly into the
                  composer&mdash; say, <markup
                  role="html">&lt;BR&gt;Bold Text&lt;/BR&gt</markup>,
                  the the composer will assume you meant exactly that,
                  and not "make this text bold," as a HTML composition
                  tool would.  For the very technically inclined, that
                  means that when the text <markup
                  role="html">&lt;BR&gt</markup> is sent as HTML, it
                  will be converted to the string
                  <literal>&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;</literal>.

                Some people do not have HTML-capable mail clients, or

            Mail, as well as address cards and calendars, is kept in
            folders.  If you like, you can create new folders by
            selecting <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu> and then
            <guimenuitem>Folder</guimenuitem> from the
            <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu, or by pressing
            <keysym>COMBO</keysym>.  (Will there be a dialog box to

            describe.) The new folders will appear in the
            <interface>tree view</interface>, and you can drag them
            wherever you want to relocate them.  You can move messages
            into the folders by dragging and dropping, or by selecting
            them and choosing <guimenuitem>ITEM</guimenuitem> from the

	  <title>Getting Really Organized with Virtual Folders</title>
	  <para>
            If you find yourself performing a search frequently, you
            can save it as a virtual folder. Virtual folders, or
            vFolders, are an advanced way of viewing your email
            messages within <application>Evolution</application>.  If
            you get a lot of mail or often forget where you put
            messages, vFolders can help you stay on top of things.
          </para>
          <para>
            A vFolder looks and acts a lot like a folder, but it's
            actually a saved search that you can access in most of the
            same ways you would a regular folder.  The one important
            differences between them is that a conventional folder
            actually contains messages, but a vFolder is a view of
            messages that may be in several different folders.  This
            means that while a message may fall into several vFolders,
            it can be in only one conventional folder.  Also, it means
            that you cannot remove a message from a vFolder unless you
            delete it, and you cannot add a message to a vFolder
            unless you change the vFolder's search criteria.
          </para>
	  <para>
            As messages that meet the vFolder criteria arrive or are
            deleted, <application>Evolution</application> will
            automatically place them in and and remove them from the
            vFolder contents list.  When you delete a message, it gets
            erased from the folder it actually exists in as well as
            any vFolders which include it.
          </para>
	  <para>
            That's pretty complicated.  But it can be useful. For
            example, if I have a folder for all the email from one
            person, and another folder for all the email on a given
            topic, I feel organized. But when the person sends me
            mail about the topic, my whole email filing universe
            becomes chaotic.  I need vFolders to save the day for me.
          </para>
	  <para>
            That sounds silly, but imagine a business trying to keep
	    track of mail from hundreds of vendors and clients, or a
	    university with overlapping and changing groups of
	    faculty, staff, administrators and students.  The larger
	    the system, the less you can afford that sort of
	    confusion.  vFolders make for better organization because
	    they can accept overlapping groups in a way that regular
	    folders and filing systems can't.
          </para>

	  <example id="usage-mail-organize-vFolders-ex">
	    <title>Using Folders, Searches, and vFolders</title>
	    <para>
	       To organize my mail box, I can set up a vFolder
	       for emails from my friend Vince, by doing (INSERT
	       PROCESS HERE).  Then, whenever I want to see the
	       messages Vince has sent me, I open the vFolder, and
	       every message he's sent me shows up, no matter where
	       I've actually filed it.  If I want, I can also create a
	       vFolder containing any message from my list of
	       co-workers which also has the name of the project in
	       it.  That way, when Vince sends me mail about the
	       project, I can see that message both in the "Vince"
	       vFolder and in the "Project" vFolder.  That's because
	       when I open up the "Vince" folder, I'm really
	       performing a search for all the mail from Vince, and
	       when I open the "Project" folder I'm really performing
	       a search for all the mail about the project.

          <para> The <interface>filter druid</interface> window
            contains a window listing rules, and an option to create a
            new rule.  To start filtering your mail, click
            <guibutton>Add</guibutton> to add a filtering rule.
            You'll decide when it should take place: 
              <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
                   <para>
                     <guilabel>When mail arrives:</guilabel> Select
		     this option to have messages filtered as they
		     arrive.
                   </para>
                 </listitem>
                 <listitem>
                   <para>
                     <guilabel>When mail is sent:</guilabel> Select
                     this option to filter your outgoing mail.  You
                     can use this feature to keep your
                     <interface>Outbox</interface> as organized as
                     your <interface>Inbox</interface>.
                 </para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
          </para>

           Then, the filter druid will ask you which emails it should
           act upon.  You can set criteria to include words or phrases
           in the subject, To:, Cc: or body of the message.  Once
           you've decided which messages to filter, the druid will ask
           you the sort of action you wish to take.  More details and
           screenshots should follow here.
