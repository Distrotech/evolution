    <title> An Overview of the Evolution Mailer</title>
    <para>
       <application>Evolution</application> email is like other email
       programs in all the ways you would hope:
     <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It can sort and organize your mail in a wide variety of ways with
	   folders, searches, and filters.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	  It can send and receive mail in HTML or as plain text, and
	  supports file attachments.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It supports multiple mail sources, including IMAP, POP3,
	   and local <filename>mbox</filename> files.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      However, <application>Evolution</application> has some important
      differences.  First, it's built to handle very large amounts of
      mail without slowing down or crashing.  Both the <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link> functions
      were built for speed and efficiency on gargantuan mail
      volumes. There's also the <application>Evolution</application>
      <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">vFolder</link>, an
      advanced organizational feature not found in other mail clients.
      If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep every message you get
      in case you need to refer to it later, you'll find that feature
      especially useful.
    </para>

    <para>
       You can start reading email by clicking
       <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> in the shortcut bar.  By
       default, the <interface>Inbox</interface> is open when you
       start <application>Evolution</application>, and the first
       time you see your inbox, there's a message in it from Helix
       Code welcoming you to the application.

	The first time you open your
	<application>Evolution</application>
	<guilabel>Inbox</guilabel>, you will see a window like the one
	in <xref linkend="usage-mail-intro-fig">, with a message from

	open in a new window.  As is the case with folders, you can
	right-click on messages in the message list and get a menu of

         You can also select the order in which messages appear in

         bars with those labels at the top of the message list.  If
         you click twice, you'll sort them in reverse order.
      </para>
      <para>
         Aside from sorting the messages, you can opt to have the
         messages threaded. Select <menuchoice>
         <guimenu>View</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Threaded Message
         List</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> to turn the threaded view on
         or off.  If the option selected,
         <application>Evolution</application> will attempt to
         associate related messages by using the
         <systemitem>References</systemitem>,
         <systemitem>In-Reply-To</systemitem>, and
         <systemitem>Subject</systemitem> message headers.  Messages
         which are related are then placed next to each other, so that
         it's easier to follow the thread of a conversation from
         message to message.
      </para>
      <para>
	Go ahead and click on the message in the <interface>message
	list</interface>.  That selects the message.  Then click on
	the <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button in the tool bar.  The
	message now has a line through it, because you've marked it
	for deletion.  If you really want to get rid of it, choose
	<guimenuitem>Expunge</guimenuitem> from the
	<guimenu>Tools</guimenu> menu.  That will delete it
	permanently. If you want to keep it, click
	<guibutton>Delete</guibutton> again, and it will no longer be
	marked as deleted.  At some point in the future, this feature
	will change to something a little less counter-intuitive.

      <para>
	To check your email, just click <guibutton>Get

	you've done so, the <interface>mail setup
	assistant</interface> will ask you for the information it
	needs to check your mail (see <xref
	linkend="config-setupassist"> for more information).  If
	you're checking mail over a network (instead of from local
	<filename>mbox</filename> files), you'll need to enter your
	email password.  Type it in, click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> and
	<application>Evolution</application> will download your mail.
	New mail will appear in your <interface>Inbox</interface>.
	<!-- FIXME: add mention of Today if Today feature appears -->
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you've entered your password,
        <application>Evolution</application> will hold it in memory so
        that you don't have to retype it every time you want to check
        mail.  It will only remember the password until you quit the
        application; each time you run
        <application>Evolution</application>, you need to re-enter
        your password.  If you'd like
        <application>Evolution</application> to forget your password
        sooner, select
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Actions</guimenu><guimenuitem>Forget
        Passwords</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, and it will do so
        immediately.

      <para>
	If you get an error message instead of mail, you probably
	need to change your network settings.  To learn how to
	do that, have a look at <xref

	administrator.

	<title>Attachments, HTML Mail, and Live Documents</title>
	<para>
	  If someone sends you a file attached to an email (an
	  "attachment"), <application>Evolution</application> will
	  display the file at the bottom of the message to which it's
	  attached.  Text, HTML, and most images will be displayed in
	  the message itself.  For other files,
	  <application>Evolution</application> will provide a link and
	  icon at the end of the message.  Click on that, and
	  <application>Evolution</application> will ask you where you
	  want to put the file.  Once you've chosen a location and
	  saved the file, you can open, move, copy, or execute it just
	  like any other, using <application>Nautilus</application> or
	  your favorite shell or file manager.
	</para>

	<para>
	   <application>Evolution</application> can also display
	   HTML-formatted mail, complete with graphics.  HTML
	   formatting will display automatically, although you can
	   turn it off if you prefer.

	  <para>
	    In addition, you can mark recipients in three different
	    ways.  The <guilabel>To:</guilabel> field is for the
	    primary recipients of the message you are going to send.
	    However, it is considered bad form to have more than a few
	    email addresses in this section.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you're writing to one person, but want to keep a third
	    party up to date, you can use <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel>.
	    Hearkening back to the dark ages when people used
	    typewriters and there were no copy machines, "Cc" stands
	    for "Carbon Copy."  Use it whenever you want to share a
	    message you've written to someone else.
	    <example>
	      <title>Using the Cc: field</title>
	      <para>
	         When Susan sends an email to a client, she puts her
	         co-worker, Tim, in the in the
	         <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> field, so that he know
	         what's going on.  The client can see that Tim also
	         received the message, and knows that he can talk to
	         Tim about the message as well.
	      </para>
	    </example>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you have a large number of recipients, or if you want
	    to send mail to several people without sharing the
	    recipient list, you should use
	    <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel>. "Bcc" stands for "Blind Carbon
	    Copy", and means that people you put in the
	    <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel> field get the message, but
	    nobody else sees their email address.  They will still see
	    the list of addresses from the <guilabel>To:</guilabel>
	    and <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> fields, though.

	    <example id="ex-mail-bcc">
	      <title>Using the Bcc: field</title>
	      <para>
	         Tim is sending an email announcement to all of his

	         with each other, and all of whom value their
	         privacy. He needs to use the

            You can't normally use text treatments or pictures in

	    people refer to HTML mail as "the root of all evil" and
	    get very angry if you send them HTML mail, which is why

    <sect2 id="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">
      <title>Getting Really Organized with Virtual Folders</title>
      <para>
	If filters aren't flexible enough for you, or you find
	yourself performing the same search again and again, consider
	a virtual folder. Virtual folders, or vFolders, are an
	advanced way of viewing your email messages within
	<application>Evolution</application>.  If you get a lot of
	mail or often forget where you put messages, vFolders can help
	you stay on top of things.
      </para>
      <para>
	A vFolder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational
	tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you
	set it up like a filter.  Once you've set it up, you'll be
	able to open it and read the messages in it as though it were
	a normal mail folder.  It's not a folder, though, because when
	you open a vFolder, <application>Evolution</application>
	performs a search for you.  It's not a regular search, though,
	because you can build a vFolder with a very complicated set of
	criteria with multiple inclusions and exclusions, as though
	you were setting up a filter.
      </para>

<!-- potentially useful, but doesn't fit at the moment:
     <para>
       An important difference between a folder and a virtual folder
	is that a conventional folder actually contains messages, but
	a vFolder is a view of messages that may be in several
	different folders.  This means that while a message may fall
	into several vFolders, it can be in only one conventional
	folder.  Also, it means that you cannot remove a message from
	a vFolder unless you delete it, and you cannot add a message
	to a vFolder unless you change the vFolder's search criteria.
      </para>
-->

      <para>
	As messages that meet the vFolder criteria arrive or are
	deleted, <application>Evolution</application> will
	automatically place them in and and remove them from the
	vFolder contents list.  When you delete a message, it gets
	erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as
	any vFolders which include it.
      </para>
      <para>
	That's pretty complicated, but it can be useful. For example,
	if I have a folder for all the email from one person, and
	another folder for all the email on a given topic, I
	<emphasis>feel</emphasis> organized.  But when the person
	sends me mail about the topic, my whole email filing universe
	becomes chaotic, and I need vFolders to save the day for me.
      </para>
      <para>
	That sounds silly, but imagine a business trying to keep track
	of mail from hundreds of vendors and clients, or a university
	with overlapping and changing groups of faculty, staff,
	administrators and students.  The more mail you need to organize, the less
	you can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an
	organizational system that's not flexible enough.  vFolders
	make for better organization because they can accept
	overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing
	systems can't.
      </para>

      <example id="usage-mail-organize-vFolders-ex">
	<title>Using Folders, Searches, and vFolders</title>
	<para>
	   To organize my mail box, I can set up a vFolder for emails
	   from my friend Vince.  Then, whenever I want to see the
	   messages Vince has sent me, I open the vFolder, and every
	   message he's sent me shows up, no matter where I've
	   actually filed it.  If I want, I can also create a vFolder
	   containing any message from my list of co-workers which
	   also has the name of the project in it.  That way, when
	   Vince sends me mail about the project, I can see that
	   message both in the "Vince" vFolder and in the "Project"
	   vFolder.  That's because when I open up the "Vince" folder,
	   I'm really performing a search for all the mail from Vince,
	   and when I open the "Project" folder I'm really performing
	   a search for all the mail about the project.

	 not created any, there will be only one available option:
	 click <guibutton>Add</guibutton> to add a new vFolder.
      </para>
      <para>
	 You'll be prompted to create a filtering rule.  You can build
	 your own from the ground up, or select one of several base
	 rules to customize.  Your options are:
    <variablelist>
	 <varlistentry>
	    <term><guilabel>For matching messages:</guilabel></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        Choose this to create your own set of rules for the
	        vFolder.  You may select one or more search criteria;
	        the vFolder you create will contain messages that
	        match all of them.
	     </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><guilabel>Messages from a certain person:</guilabel></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		 The remaining three rules are simpler.  Select this
		 one to create a vFolder that will contain only
		 messages from an address you enter.
	     </para>
	   </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><guilabel>Messages to a certain address:</guilabel</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	         Any messages sent directly to this address will be in
	         the vFolder you create.  This vFolder is an absolute
	         must for people with multiple email addresses.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><guilabel>Messages with a given subject:</guilabel></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Enter a subject, and the vFolder will contain messages
		with that subject.
	     </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	</variablelist>

        The selection window is shown in <xref

	Once you click <guibutton>Next</guibutton>, you'll customize
	the vFolder rule.  The rules for the vFolder you're creating
	will appear as phrases in the bottom pane of the window.  You
	can click on the blue underlined text in the phrase to alter
	it to your liking.  For example, when I create a vFolder to
	contain all messages from <email>rupert@helixcode.com</email>
	that have the word "evolution" in the message body, the bottom
	frame says: <computeroutput>The From address matches
	rupert@helixcode.com and the body contains
	"evolution".</computeroutput>.
