  <title>Managing your Schedule</title>

     <para>
      This chapter will show you how to use the Ximian Evolution
      Calendar to manage your schedule alone or in conjunction with
      others.

    <title>Ways of Looking at your Calendar</title>
    <para>
       The toolbar offers you four different views of your calendar:
       one day, five days, a week, or a month at once. Press the
       calendar-shaped buttons on the right side of the toolbar to
       switch between views. You can also select a range of
       days&mdash; three days, ten days, a fortnight if you want
       &mdash; in the small calendar at the upper right.
    </para>
    <para>
       The <guibutton>Prev</guibutton> and <guibutton>Next</guibutton>
       buttons will move you forward and back in your calendar pages.
       If you're looking at only one day, you'll see tomorrow's page,
       or yesterday's.  If you're looking at your calendar by week,
       month, fortnight, or anything else, you'll move around by just
       that much. To come back to today's listing, click
       <guibutton>Today</guibutton>.
    </para>
    <para>
       To visit a specific date's calendar entries, click
       <guibutton>Go To</guibutton> and select the date in the dialog
       box that appears.
    </para>

    <title>Scheduling With the Evolution Calendar</title>
    <para>
      Of course, you'll want to use the calendar to do more than find
      out what day it is. This section will tell you how to schedule
      appointments, set alarms, and determine appointment recurrence.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="usage-calendar-apts-basic">
      <title>Creating appointments</title>
      <para>
	To create a new appointment, select
        <menuchoice>
	  <guimenu>File</guimenu>
	  <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Appointment</guimenuitem>
	</menuchoice>
	or click the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button on the left end
	of the toolbar. The <interface>New Appointment</interface>
	dialog will pop up with the usual menu bar, tool bar, and
	window full of choices for you.
      </para>
      <tip id="new-appointment-shortcut">
        <title>Shortcut</title>
        <para>
           If you don't need to enter more information than the date
           and time of the appointment, you just click in any blank
           space in the calendar and start typing. You can enter other
           information later with the appointment editor.
        </para>
      </tip>

      <para>
        Your appointment must have a starting and ending date &mdash; by
        default, today &mdash; but you can choose whether to give it
        starting and ending times or to mark it as an <guilabel>All
        day event</guilabel>. An <guilabel>All day event</guilabel>
        appears at the top of a day's appointment list rather than inside
        it.  That makes it easy to have appointments that overlap and fit
        inside each other.  For example, a conference might be an all
        day appointment, and the meetings at the conference would be timed
        appointments.  Of course, appointments with specific starting and ending
        times can also overlap.  When they do they're displayed as
        multiple columns in the day view of the calendar.
      </para>
      <note>
       <title>Multiple Simultanious Appointments</title>
         <para>
           If you create calendar appointments that overlap,
           <application>Evolution</application> will display them side
           by side in your calendar.  However,
           <application>Evolution</application> cannot help you do
           multiple things at once.

         You can have as many as four different
         <guilabel>Alarms</guilabel>, any time prior to the appointment
         you've scheduled.  You can have one alarm of each of the following types:

	</para>
      </tip>

      <para>
	 The purpose of categories is to let you view all appointments which have
	 similar activities.  To do this, change <guilabel>Any field contains</guilabel>
	 to <guilabel>Has category</guilabel> and enter your category at right.
      </para>

      <para>
	Clicking on the <guibutton>Categories</guibutton> button opens up the category

      <para>
	Once you've selected your categories, click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to
	assign these categories to the appointment.  The categories you selected are now
	listed in the text box to the right of the <guibutton>Categories...</guibutton>
	button.

      <para>
        The <guilabel>Recurrence</guilabel> tab lets you describe
        repetition in appointments ranging from once every day up to once
        every 100 years.  You can then choose a time and date when the
        appointment will stop recurring, and, under
        <guilabel>Exceptions</guilabel>, pick individual days when the
        appointment will <emphasis>not</emphasis> recur. Make your
        selections from left to right, and you'll form a sentence:
        "Every two weeks on Monday and Friday until January 3, 2003"
        or "Every month on the first Friday for 12 occurrences."
      </para>

      <para>
	Once you're done with all those settings, click on the disk
	icon in the toolbar.  That will save the appointment and close the
	appointment editor window. If you want, you can alter an appointment
	summary in the calendar view by clicking on it and typing. You
	can change other settings by right-clicking on the appointment then
	choosing <guimenuitem>Edit this Appointment</guimenuitem>.

       The Task Pad, located in the lower right corner of the

       due-date (see <xref linkend="config-prefs"> for more
       information), and are included with calendar data during
       synchronization with a hand-held device.  You can use the list

        Keelyn, the office manager for a small company, has one
        calendar for her own schedule.  On the local network, she
        maintains one for the conference room, so people know when
        they can schedule meetings.  Next to that, she maintains a
        calendar that reflects when consultants are going to be on
        site, and another that keeps track of when the Red Sox are
        playing.
