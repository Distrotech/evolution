      <para>
        The first time you try to use email, or when you create a new
        email account, the mail setup assistant will ask you for some
        basic information, so <application>Evolution</application> can
        let you use email. If you prefer more detailed configuration,
        or if you want to make changes to an existing email setup, see
        <xref linkend="config-prefs">.
      </para>

      <title>Mail Setup</title>
      <para>
        The first time you try to send or receive mail with
	<application>Evolution</application>, the <interface>mail
	setup assistant</interface> will pop up to help you with your
	email preferences.  If you don't plan to use email, or if
	you'd rather deal with your email preferences later, click
	<guibutton>Cancel</guibutton>.
      </para>

<!--  

        Before you get it, though, you should decide where you want to
	keep it.  Your options will vary a little depending on your
	network setup, but they come down to storing the mail on your
	hard disk (using <glossterm linkend="pop">POP</glossterm>), or
	storing it on the network (using <glossterm
	linkend="imap">IMAP</glossterm>).  If you store your mail on
	your local hard disk, you can read it whether you're online or
	not, but you can only read it from one computer.  If you store
	it on the network, you can only read it when you're online,
	but you can access it from almost any computer with a network
	connection, even if it doesn't have
	<application>Evolution</application>.


        If you choose POP, you'll be putting mail in the
        <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Local</guilabel>
        folder.  If you choose IMAP, it's the
        <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> of a folder with the same name as
        your mail server.  That's so you can maintain several distinct
        IMAP servers if you want.  See <xref
        linkend="config-prefs-mail"> for more information about mail
        servers.

      <para>
         The setup assistant (sometimes called a
	 <glossterm>Druid</glossterm>, by analogy with the "Wizards"
	 that some other programs use) will guide you through the
	 network configuration process.  It will ask you for some
	 basic information; your system administrator or ISP should
	 have the answers you'll need.  The mail setup assistant is
	 pictured in <xref linkend="usage-setup-fig">.

  The assistant will ask you for the following information:

          <varlistentry>
               <term> <guilabel>Name:</guilabel> </term> <listitem>

       </varlistentry>

       <varlistentry>
          <term> <guilabel>Organization:</guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              Any organization you represent, or the company where you
              work.  Leave this blank if you wish, or type "My own bad
              self" so people know your opinions are yours alone.
            </para>
	  </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	 <term><guilabel>Signature File:</guilabel></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
             A text file appended to any email you send.  A signature
             file typically consists of your name and email address,
             or a quotation you like.  It's good form to keep your
             "sig" on the short side: four lines is plenty. Remember,
             this is attached to every email you send.
            </para>
         </listitem>
       </varlistentry>

       <varlistentry>
           <term> <guilabel>Mail source type:</guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              <application>Evolution</application> supports several
              mail sources: <glossterm linkend="pop">POP</glossterm>
              and <glossterm linkend="imap">IMAP</glossterm> servers,
              and UNIX-style
              <systemitem><filename>mbox</filename></systemitem> and
              <systemitem><filename>mh</filename></systemitem> files.
              POP servers retrieve your mail and store it on your
              local system so you can refer to it even when not
              connected to a network; <glossterm>IMAP</glossterm>
              servers store the mail on the server so you can access
              it from multiple locations;
              <systemitem><filename>mbox</filename>></systemitem>
              files are used by your computer for internal mail, and
              may be useful if you want to switch from another email
              client such as <application>Spruce</application> or
              <application>Netscape Communicator</application>.  Ask
              your system administrator or ISP which you should use,
              or keep guessing until one works.  If you wish, you may
              use multiple sources by creating additional accounts.
              See <xref linkend="config-prefs-mail"> for more
              information.
            </para>
            <para>
              If you decide not to have
              <application>Evolution</application> use any servers,
              the remaining items are not relevant; you only need to
              point to the location of the files you wish to access.

          <term> <guilabel>Server:</guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              This should be the name of the server where you get
              incoming mail.  It may (or may not) be the same as the
              server where you send your outgoing mail.

     <varlistentry>

	<listitem>
             <para>
              Enter the username for your mail server account, if you
              have one. In almost all cases, this is the part of your email
              address before the @ character, and
              <application>Evolution</application> has selected that
              value as the default.  If you have a different username,
              you can enter it here.

	    <listitem>
	    <para>
              Select the type of authentication you will use.  You can
              click <guibutton>Detect supported types</guibutton> to
              find out which authentication protocols your network
              allows.

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              This is the mail sending protocol you will want to use.
              <application>Evolution</application> supports both
              <glossterm linkend="smtp">SMTP</glossterm> and
              <application>sendmail</application>; SMTP is by far the
              more common.
