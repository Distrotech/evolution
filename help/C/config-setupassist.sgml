      <para>
        The first time you try to send or receive mail with
	<application>Evolution</application>, the <interface>mail
	setup assistant</interface> will pop up to help you with your
	email preferences.  If you don't plan to use email, or if
	you'd rather deal with your email preferences later, click

         The setup assistant (sometimes called a
	 <glossterm>Druid</glossterm>) will guide you through the
	 network configuration process.  It will ask you for some
	 basic information; your system administrator or ISP should
	 have the answers you'll need.  The mail setup assistant is
	 pictured in <xref linkend="usage-setup-fig">.
