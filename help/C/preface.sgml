        <application>Evolution</application>.  If you are new to
        <application>Evolution</application> or to groupware in
        general, this section is for you. The second section, covering
        <link linkend="config">configuration</link>, is targeted at
        more advanced users, but anyone who wants to change the way

        If you're already familiar with Ximian Evolution 1.0, our new
        version has a lot to add.  Here are some of the new and
        changed features. Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange also
        has new features, which are covered in "new-in-connector-one-two">.

	    <term>Evolution Settings Interface</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                The preferences dialogs have been completely
                overhauled. There is now a single configuration dialog
                window for all components of the program, and you can
                access it from anywhere. To change your preferences,

	    <term>Mail Composer Autocomplete</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Email addresses in the message composer can now work
                with LDAP address books. Add your LDAP address book to
                the list of folders searched for address completion in
                the <guilabel>Folder Settings</guilabel> section of
                the Settings dialog.

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Performance Improvements</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Startup time has decreased, POP server interactions
                are more efficient, and indexing of locally cached
                mail is now faster.

	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>


	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Mail Composer HTML Improvements</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                 Pasting into the mail composer from another message
                or from a web page preserves the HTML formatting of
                the source document. Multiple levels of reply
                quotation in messages are clearer and use a vertical
                blue line on the left side to indicate quotation. Text
                "smileys" are now automatically converted to small
                images displaying the appropriate emotion. You can
                turn this option off in the
                <guilabel>Composer</guilabel> section of the Settings
                dialog.

	    <term>Signature Editor</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                 There is now a signature editor, which can be used to
                 create plain text or HTML signatures. 
                 click the the <guilabel>Signatures</guilabel> tab in
                 the Composer Settings section of the Evolution
                 Settings window.

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Keyboard Navigation Overhaul</term>
	    <listitem>
              <para>
                All unmodified letter keys have changed function-- the
                <keycap>N</keycap> and <keycap>P</keycap> keys, for
                example, no longer take you to the next you to the
                next or previous message.  Pressing a letter will now
                take you to the nearest message whose data in the sort
                column begins with that letter. That is, if you press
                N and you are sorting your list by sender, you will
                move to a message from Nadine. If you are sorting by
                subject, you'll move to the message about
                nectarines. This should also work in the folder list
                for folder navigation.
              </para>
	      <para>
               This means that the old single letter shortcuts have
               changed as well.  The new shortcuts:
                <simplelist>
		  <member>
                    <keycap>,</keycap> (comma) and <keycap>.</keycap>
                    (period) are now the keyboard shortcuts for Next
                    and Previous unread messages. You can also use the
                    square brackets <keycap>]</keycap> and
                    <keycap>[</keycap>.
                 </member>
		 <member>
                   <keycap>`</keycap> (backtick) toggles
                   the message preview pane.
                 </member>
		</simplelist>
                Shortcuts that use the <keycap>Control</keycap> key
                have not changed.

	      <para>
                The <guibutton>New</guibutton> now has a menu next to
                it. As in Evolution 1.0, you can click the button once
                to get a new item for the Evolution tool you're
                using. However, if you click the small arrow menu to
                the right of the button, you will find a menu that
                allows you to create new items for the rest of
                Evolution: All day appointments, regular appointments,
                tasks and meetings for the calendar; mail messages for
                the mail tool; and contacts and contact lists for the
                address book.

	      <para>
                vFolders can now display the actual folder location
                for each message they contain.  To do so, right click
                on the column headers in the message list of any
                vFolder, select <guimenuitem>Add a
                Column</guimenuitem>, and drag the <guibutton>Original

	      <para>
               This feature is often called "Bounce" or "Redirect." To
