        This book is divided into two parts, with several
        appendices. The first part is a <link linkend="usage">guided

        <application>Evolution</application>.  If you are new to
        <application>Evolution</application> or to groupware in
        general, this section is for you. The second section, covering
        <link linkend="config">configuration</link>, is targeted at
        more advanced users, but anyone who wants to change the way

      <title>What's New in Evolution 1.2</title>
      <para>
        If you're already familiar with Ximian Evolution 1.0, you may
        want to know what has changed in this release. Aside from
        performance benefits like faster POP server interaction, there
        are new features and options, including some that may surprise
        or confuse you. Here is a list of new and changed features:
      <variablelist>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Configuration Interface</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                The preferences dialogs have been completely
                overhauled. There is now a single configuration dialog
                window for all components of the program, and you can
                access it from anywhere. To change your preferences,
                select 
                 <menuchoice>
		  <guimenu>
                      Tools
                  </guimenu>
		  <guimenuitem>
                     Configure
                  </guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
              </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Folder Preferences for Autocompletion and Offline Mode</term>
	    <listitem>
              <para>
               You may now select which network folders which will be
               cached locally when you go into Offline mode. Offline
               mode now works better in general.
             </para>
	      <para>
                You may also select which contact folders will be used
                to autocomplete addresses in the mail composer.
             </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Redirect (Bounce) Feature Added</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
               To redirect a message with all its headers instead of
               merely forwarding it, select the message and choose     
                 <menuchoice>
		  <guimenu>
                      Actions
                  </guimenu>
		  <guisubmenu>
                     Forward
                  </guisubmenu>
		  <guimenuitem>
                      Redirect
                  </guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
             </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Digest-mode Display of Forwarded Messages</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Messages that have been forwarded to you as
                attachments are now displayed in "Digest Mode" rather
                than inline.
             </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>New Mail Notification</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                When new mail arrives, you may opt to have Evolution
                beep or play a sound file that you specify.
             </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Letter Keyboard Shortcuts</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Pressing an unmodified letter key in the Folder Bar
                now takes you to the next folder that starts with that
                letter; if there are several, you can press the key
                again and it will go to the next folder that starts
                with that letter.  Similarly, you can press a letter
                key in the message list and the message selection will
                move to the next message whose sender begins with that
                letter. For example, you could press the
                <keycap>r</keycap> key to go to the next message that
                Russell sent you.
              </para>
	      <para>
                That means that unmodified letter shortcuts from
                Evolution 1.0 won't work any more. The changes are:
                <simplelist>
		  <member>
                    <keycap>,</keycap> (comma) and <keycap>.</keycap>
                    (period) are now the keyboard shortcuts for Next
                    and Previous unread messages
                 </member>
		 <member>
                   <keycap>'</keycap> (the single apostrophe) toggles
                   the message preview pane.
                 </member>
		</simplelist>
                Shortcuts that used the <keycap>Control</keycap> key
                are not affected.
             </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Added Functionality for the "New" Button</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                The <guibutton>New</guibutton> now has a menu next to
                it. As in Evolution 1.0, you can click the button once
                to get a new item for the Evolution tool you're
                using. However, if you click the small arrow menu to
                the right of the button, you will find a menu that
                allows you to create new items for the rest of
                Evolution: All day appointments, regular appointments,
                tasks and meetings for the calendar; mail messages for
                the mail tool; and contacts and contact lists for the
                address book.
