        This book is divided into two parts, with several

        general, this section is for you. The second section, covering

      <title>What's New in Evolution 1.2</title>
      <para>
        If you're already familiar with Ximian Evolution 1.0, our new
        version has a lot to add.  Here are some of the new and
        changed features:
        <variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Configuration Interface</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                The preferences dialogs have been completely
                overhauled. There is now a single configuration dialog
                window for all components of the program, and you can
                access it from anywhere. To change your preferences,
                select 
                 <menuchoice>
		  <guimenu>
                      Tools
                  </guimenu>
		  <guimenuitem>
                     Configure
                  </guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
              </para>

	  </varlistentry>

	    <term>Performance Improvements</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Startup time has decreased, POP server interactions
                are more efficient, and indexing of locally cached
                mail is now faster.
              </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	    <term>Keyboard Navigation Overhaul</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Pressing an unmodified letter key in the Folder Bar
                now takes you to the next folder that starts with that
                letter; if there are several, you can press the key
                again and it will go to the next folder that starts
                with that letter.  Similarly, you can press a letter
                key in the message list and the message selection will
                move to the next message whose sender begins with that
                letter. For example, you could press the
                <keycap>r</keycap> key to go to the next message that
                Russell sent you.
              </para>
	      <para>
                That means that unmodified letter shortcuts from
                Evolution 1.0 won't work any more. The changes are:
                <simplelist>
		  <member>
                    <keycap>,</keycap> (comma) and <keycap>.</keycap>
                    (period) are now the keyboard shortcuts for Next
                    and Previous unread messages
                 </member>
		 <member>
                   <keycap>'</keycap> (the single apostrophe) toggles
                   the message preview pane.
                 </member>
		</simplelist>
                Shortcuts that used the <keycap>Control</keycap> key
                are not affected.
             </para>

	  <varlistentry>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                The <guibutton>New</guibutton> now has a menu next to
                it. As in Evolution 1.0, you can click the button once
                to get a new item for the Evolution tool you're
                using. However, if you click the small arrow menu to
                the right of the button, you will find a menu that
                allows you to create new items for the rest of
                Evolution: All day appointments, regular appointments,
                tasks and meetings for the calendar; mail messages for
                the mail tool; and contacts and contact lists for the
                address book.

                You can now mark messages by color (Right click on a

	      <para>
                vFolders and filters now notice if you move or delete

                 You can now filter based on score, flag-for-followup
                 or message coloration status, or the existence of
                 attachments. New actions include beeping, playing
                 sounds, running shell commands, and piping messages
                 to external processes.
