      <title> What is Evolution, and What Can It Do for Me?</title>
      <para>
        The word "evolution" means "a process of improvement and
        development."  The GNOME application
        <application>Evolution</application> is meant to be a more
        evolved <glossterm>groupware</glossterm> program, and an
        integral part of the Internet-connected desktop.
      </para>
      <para>
        As part of the GNOME project,
        <application>Evolution</application> is free software, and is
        released under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).  As
        stated previously, the documentation falls under the Free
        Documentation License (FDL), which is included with this
        document in <xref linkend="fdl">.  For more information about

      </para>
      <para>
        <application>Evolution</application> is a suite of tools to
        help you work in a group.  You can use it to send, receive,
        and organize email, manage address and other contact
        information, and maintain a calendar.  It enables you to do
        those things on one or several computers, connected directly
        or over a network, for one person or for large groups.
        <application>Evolution</application> can handle almost all
        your communications tasks with the power and flexibility of
        the GNOME desktop environment.
      </para>
      <para>
        The developers of <application>Evolution</application> had
        four major goals for their project:

        <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              The application must be <emphasis>both powerful and easy
             to use</emphasis>. That means a familiar and intuitive
             interface that users could customize to their liking, and
             the development of shortcuts for complex tasks.
            </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              <application>Evolution</application> must meet and
              exceed the standards set by other groupware products.
              It must include support for most major network protocols
              so that it can integrate seamlessly with existing
              hardware and network environments.
            </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
               The project must support open standards and protocols
               to turn <application>Evolution</application> into an
               advanced development platform.  From the simplest
               scripting to the most complex network and component
               programming, <application>Evolution</application>
               needed to offer developers an environment for
               cutting-edge application development.

               Data must be safe: <application>Evolution</application>
               must not lose mail or corrupt mailbox files.  It will
               not execute scripts, automatically forward a virus to
               your entire contacts list, or delete files from your
               hard disk.
            </para>
          </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
        <application>Evolution</application> is designed to make most
        daily tasks faster.  For example, it takes only one or two
        clicks to enter an appointment or an address card sent to you
        by email, or to send email to a contact or appointment.
        <application>Evolution</application> makes displays faster and
        more efficient, so searches are faster and memory usage is
        lower.  People who get lots of mail will appreciate advanced
        features like <link
        linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">vFolders</link>, which
        let you save searches as though they were ordinary mail
        folders.

      <para>
        This book is divided into two sections. The first section is a
        <link linkend="usage">guided tour</link>&mdash; it will
        explain how to use <application>Evolution</application>.  If
        you are new to <application>Evolution</application> or to
        groupware in general, this is the section for you. The second
        section, covering <link linkend="config">configuration</link>,
        is targeted at more advanced users, but anyone who wants to
        change the way <application>Evolution</application> looks or
        acts can benefit from reading it.
