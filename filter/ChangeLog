2003-10-22  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@ximian.com>

	* filter.glade: Remove Viewports around the treeviews, since they
	already have a scrolled window around them and the viewports cause
	a double bevel to appear.

	window have a GTK_SHADOW_IN shadow.
	* vfolder-rule.c (vfolder_editor_sourcelist_new): Likewise

	** See Natzilla task #47524

	* filter-rule.h (FilterRule): add a system bit, for rules that

	contains system searches that cannot be deleted.

2003-08-18  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@ximian.com>

	* vfolder-rule.c (source_add): As a temporary measure, don't call
	evolution_shell_client_user_select_folder() since this is not done
	by the shell anymore.

	* filter-folder.c (get_widget): Return NULL for now, since we
	can't get the folder selector button from the shell anymore.

2003-08-05  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #42636.

2003-07-23  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use EVO_MARSHAL_RULE

2003-06-13  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

2003-06-11  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@ximian.com>

2003-06-06  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Fixes some leaks from bug #43883.

	* filter-file.c (xml_decode): Free file->path and set it to
	NULL before entering the loop to decode it. This way if the value
	is already set we don't leak it. Set file->path = g_strdup (str ?
	str : ""); and then xmlFree the str.

2003-05-21  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* filter-source.c (filter_source_get_sources): Same as below.
