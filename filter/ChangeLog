	* filter-driver.c: Removed a bunch of crappy unrequired headers.

	* Makefile.am (filter_driver_LDADD): Added libibex back again.

2000-04-18  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* filter-driver.c: remove unused camel-log.h include

2000-04-12  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* filter-arg.c (filter_arg_edit_value): Return a value.

2000-03-27  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-xml.c (tokenise_xmlfreeprop): Free a prop after
	tokenising it.
	(find_node_attr): Free the prop after using it.
	(load_desc): Ditto.   I use free() because xmlFree() is nowhere to
	be found.
	(filter_load_optionset): Ditto.

	* filter-arg-types.c (arg_address_values_add_xml): free() xml
	stuff, plugs a leak.
	(arg_folder_values_add_xml): Ditto.

2000-03-22  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-driver.c (main): Changed to use async search api.

2000-03-04  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-druid.c (html_write_options): Output 'and' bits between
	the rules.

	* filter-driver.c (main): Actually implement filtering, at least,
	from Inbox.  Copy messages to folder (in the same store only, so
	far), delete, and stop processing are implemented, and the logic
	to handle default processing.

	* filter-xml.c (load_optionvalue): Fix up a bug where we lost the
	name of the arg (ouch).
	* filter-xml.c: Wrapped printf's in debug macros.

2000-03-02  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-druid.c (object_destroy): Disconnect the list signal, so
	we dont get spurious emits during destroy.
	(arg_changed): Callback to update filter arg asynchronously.
	(arg_link_clicked): Edit the value non-modally.

	* filter-arg.c (filter_arg_edit_values_1): Changed to use
	non-modal interface.

2000-03-01  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am: New file.

	* Makefile: Removed.  I wonder why we are using plain Makefiles
	instead of automake Makefiles at all.

2000-02-29  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-driver.c (main): Remove gui code, this will be actual
	filtering code.

	* Makefile: Added filter-editor to the library.

	* filter-editor.c (main): Comment out, make it a proper library.

2000-02-28  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-druid.c: Removed unused header.

	* Makefile: Removed references to filter-sexp.[ch].

	* filter-sexp.[ch]: Removed some unecessary includes.  Moved to
	e-util.  Renamed callers.

2000-02-24  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-xml.c (filter_description_free): 
	(filter_load_ruleset_free): 
	(filter_load_optionset_free): Functions for memory management.

	* filter-arg.c (filter_arg_copy): Copy the values of one arg into
	another.

	* filter-editor.c: New widget, a dialogue which uses filter-druid
	to present the various editing views.
	(druid_dialogue_clicked): On finish, save the user's new filter
	definition where it came from.

	* filter-druid.c: Changed to just being a notebook with no tabs,
	rather than a full druid (no next/prev/etc buttons).
	(option_name_changed): Update the option's description as the user
	enters it in.

2000-02-22  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-xml.c (filter_clone_optionrule):
	(filter_clone_optionrule_free): 
	(filter_optionrule_new_from_rule): New utility functions for
	working with the internal rule format.

	* filter-arg.[ch]: Added new callbacks for editing a single value,
	and a new editor which shows all items in a list, and allows you
	to edit them via the single-edit method.  This needs some cleanup
	for some unused/unusable virtual methods (edit_values,
	write_html?).

	* Makefile: Add the druid for build.

	* filter-druid.c: A 'druid' widget for editing a single filter
	rule.

2000-02-21  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* .cvsignore: New file.

2000-02-18  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>
