2000-05-16  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-xml.c (filter_write_optionset): Save the description

	instead of automake Makefiles at all.

2000-02-29  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* filter-driver.c (main): Remove gui code, this will be actual
	filtering code.

	* Makefile: Added filter-editor to the library.

	definition where it came from.

	rather than a full druid (no next/prev/etc buttons).

	enters it in.

	(filter_optionrule_new_from_rule): New utility functions for
	working with the internal rule format.

	* filter-arg.[ch]: Added new callbacks for editing a single value,
	and a new editor which shows all items in a list, and allows you
	to edit them via the single-edit method.  This needs some cleanup
	for some unused/unusable virtual methods (edit_values,
	write_html?).

	* Makefile: Add the druid for build.

	* filter-druid.c: A 'druid' widget for editing a single filter
	rule.

2000-02-21  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>
