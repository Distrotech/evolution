2000-04-27  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* backend/ebook/e-card.c, backend/ebook/e-card.h: Added file as,
	office, manager, assistant, spouse, and anniversary fields.  These
	all use "X-EVOLUTION-" fields in the VCards.

	* backend/pas/pas-backend-file.c: Added all the new fields (except
	anniversary) to the list of fields.

	* contact-editor/contact-editor.glade,
	contact-editor/e-contact-editor-strings.h: Fixed some misnamed
	fields and fixed the placement of the comments field.

	display properly.

	* Makefile.am: Added ename.

2000-04-26  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* backend/ebook/e-card-types.h, backend/ebook/e-card.c,
	backend/ebook/e-card.h: Added an address label field.

	* contact-editor/contact-editor.glade,
	contact-editor/e-contact-editor-strings.h: Got rid of some unused
	fields.

	* contact-editor/e-contact-editor.c,
	contact-editor/e-contact-editor.h: Added the address label field.
	Load only.  Editing these fields seems to mess things up.

2000-04-26  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* contact-editor/e-contact-editor.c: Added proper handling of the
	email field.

	Removed all the fields that we don't use.

	* contact-editor/e-contact-editor.c,
	contact-editor/e-contact-editor.h: Made the phone fields work
	properly.  The address and email fields are temporarily turned off
	until they can be made to work as the phone fields do.

2000-04-25  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* gui/minicard/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Use
	`$(BONOBO_GNOME_CFLAGS)'.

	to get the IDLs from the installation prefix as well.
	(INCLUDES): Add `$(BONOBO_GNOME_CFLAGS)'.
	(test_client_LDADD): Use `$(BONOBO_GNOME_LIBS)' instead of
	hardcoding `-lbonobo'!  Also get rid of some other useless flags,
	as `$(BONOBO_GNOME_LIBS)' really has all what we need.
	(test_client_list_LDADD): Likewise.
	(test_card_LDADD): Likewise.
