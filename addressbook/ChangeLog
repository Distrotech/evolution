	object!
	(remove_backends_entry): Free a backend table entry; free the URI
	key.

	* backend/pas/pas-backend-file.c (pas_backend_file_add_client):
	Pass the backend as the closure data to the "destroy" handler of
	the book.  We cannot call pas_book_get_backend() in the callback
	since the book's private data has already been destroyed when the
	callback is invoked.  Alternatively, we could move the private
	data destruction step to the book's ::finalize() method.
	(pas_backend_file_book_destroy_cb): Get the backend from the
	callback's data, not from the book.
	(pas_backend_file_remove_client): Remove the book from the list of

	Also, call pas_backend_last_client_gone() if appropriate.

	anywhere.

	* backend/ebook/e-book.c (e_book_load_uri): create the book

2000-04-27  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* backend/ebook/e-card.c, backend/ebook/e-card.h: Added file as,
	office, manager, assistant, spouse, and anniversary fields.  These

	(test_client_LDADD): Use `$(BONOBO_GNOME_LIBS)' instead of
	hardcoding `-lbonobo'!  Also get rid of some other useless flags,
	as `$(BONOBO_GNOME_LIBS)' really has all what we need.
	(test_client_list_LDADD): Likewise.
	(test_card_LDADD): Likewise.
