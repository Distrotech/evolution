	* backend/ebook/Makefile.am (ORBIT_IDL): Use `-I $(datadir)/idl'
	to get the IDLs from the installation prefix as well.
	(INCLUDES): Add `$(BONOBO_GNOME_CFLAGS)'.
	(test_client_LDADD): Use `$(BONOBO_GNOME_LIBS)' instead of
	hardcoding `-lbonobo'!  Also get rid of some other useless flags,
	as `$(BONOBO_GNOME_LIBS)' really has all what we need.
	(test_client_list_LDADD): Likewise.
	(test_card_LDADD): Likewise.
