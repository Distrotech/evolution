	* backend/ebook/e-card-types.h, backend/ebook/e-card.c,
	backend/ebook/e-card.h: Added an address label field.

	* contact-editor/contact-editor.glade,
	contact-editor/e-contact-editor-strings.h: Got rid of some unused
	fields.

	* contact-editor/e-contact-editor.c,
	contact-editor/e-contact-editor.h: Added the address label field.
	Load only.  Editing these fields seems to mess things up.

	email field.

	* backend/ebook/e-card-types.h, backend/ebook/e-card.c,
	gui/minicard/e-minicard.c: Prefixed the ADDR_ flags.

	* contact-editor/contact-editor.glade,
	contact-editor/e-contact-editor-strings.h: Edited the glade file.
	Removed all the fields that we don't use.

	* contact-editor/e-contact-editor.c,
	contact-editor/e-contact-editor.h: Made the phone fields work
	properly.  The address and email fields are temporarily turned off
	until they can be made to work as the phone fields do.

	* gui/minicard/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Use
	`$(BONOBO_GNOME_CFLAGS)'.

	* backend/pas/Makefile.am (idl_flags): Add `-I $(datadir)/idl' to
	pick up IDL files in the installation prefix as well.
	(INCLUDES): Use `$(BONOBO_GNOME_CFLAGS)'.

	* backend/ebook/Makefile.am (ORBIT_IDL): Use `-I $(datadir)/idl'
	to get the IDLs from the installation prefix as well.
	(INCLUDES): Add `$(BONOBO_GNOME_CFLAGS)'.
	(test_client_LDADD): Use `$(BONOBO_GNOME_LIBS)' instead of
	hardcoding `-lbonobo'!  Also get rid of some other useless flags,
	as `$(BONOBO_GNOME_LIBS)' really has all what we need.
	(test_client_list_LDADD): Likewise.
	(test_card_LDADD): Likewise.
