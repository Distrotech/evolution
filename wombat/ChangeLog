	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Removed spurious calendar directories
	from the include path.  Added "wombat" log domain for glib.
	(wombat_LDADD): Link libpcs.a instead of the old shared library.

	* wombat.c: cal-factory.h is an internal include file.  * wombat.c
	(setup_pcs): We should NOT share a CORBA_environment across all
	functions!  Use our own CORBA_environment.
	(init_bonobo): Use our own CORBA_environment.  Free the exception
	after initializing GOAD, and present some error messages if
	necessary.  (Should g_message()s for exceptional situations be
	marked for translation?).

2000-04-15  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added
	`-I$(top_builddir)/addressbook/backend/pas', and
	`-I$(top_builddir)/calendar/pcs' because that's where the
	IDL-generated files go.

2000-04-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (wombat_LDADD): use BONOBO_VFS_GNOME_LIBS instead of
	BONOBO_HTML_GNOME_LIBS.  fixes freebsd's problem running wombat.

2000-04-14  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* wombat.c (setup_pcs): Must pass "object" for the kind to
	goad_server_register(); "server" is meaningless.
	(setup_pcs): Do not free the CORBA environment more than once.
	Also, fix error messages.

	* wombat.gnorba: The GOAD ID is "evolution:calendar-factory", not
	"evolution:calendar-server".

	* ChangeLog: Started the ChangeLog for Wombat.
