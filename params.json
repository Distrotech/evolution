Also, it increases the chance\r\nthat something goes wrong and your GNOME installation gets ruined.\r\n\r\nIf you want to install in a different prefix, you need to do the\r\nfollowing things:\r\n\r\n\t* Set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to contain a\r\n          colon-separated list of all the pkg-config directories that\r\n          will be involved in the build.  This basically means a list\r\n          of $prefix/lib/pkgconfig directory names, where $prefix is\r\n          the prefix where a library is installed.\r\n\r\n\t  For example, if you have GNOME installed in /usr and you\r\n          are installing Evolution and its dependencies in\r\n          /opt/evolution, you want to do something like the following\r\n          (assuming you are using Bash):\r\n\r\n\t      export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/evolution/lib/pkgconfig\r\n\r\n\t* Edit the bonobo-activation-config.xml file (which is\r\n          normally found in /etc/bonobo-activation/) to include the\r\n          location where you are installing Evolution.\r\n\r\n\t  In the example given above (GNOME in /usr, Evolution and\r\n          dependencies in /opt/evolution), your\r\n          bonobo-activation-config.xml will have to look like this:\r\n\r\n\t      <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n\t      <oafconfig>\r\n\t        <searchpath>\r\n\t          <item>/usr/lib/bonobo/servers</item>\r\n\t          <item>/opt/evolution/lib/bonobo/servers</item>\r\n\t        </searchpath>\r\n\t      </oafconfig>\r\n\r\n\t* Pass an appropriate --prefix parameter to the configure\r\n          scripts of Evolution and its dependencies, eg:\r\n\r\n\t      ./configure --prefix=/opt/evolution\r\n\r\nMore information on how to use the configure script is available in\r\nthe INSTALL file which is part of the Evolution tarball.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL FEATURES\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nSome optional features can be enabled at compilation time by passing\r\nappropriate flags to the configure script:\r\n\r\n\t* SSL support.\r\n\r\n\t  Make sure you have Mozilla's NSS nad NSPR libraries\r\n\t  installed and pass the following flag:\r\n\r\n\t    --enable-nss\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
