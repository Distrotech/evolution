Evolution is the integrated mail, calendar and address book
distributed suite from Helix Code, Inc.

See http://www.helixcode.com/apps/evolution.php3 for more information.

Note that Evolution is still pre-alpha. This means even if you manage
to compile and run it, you might not be able to figure out how to tell
it to accidentally delete all of your mail.

If you are interested in hacking on Evolution, you should subscribe to
the Evolution mailing list. Send mail to
"evolution-request@helixcode.com" with the word "subscribe" in the
body of the message.

Some hints on compiling Evolution can be found in the mailing list
archive:
