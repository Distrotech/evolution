Evolution is the integrated mail, calendar and address book
distributed suite from Helix Code, Inc.

See http://www.helixcode.com/apps/evolution.php3 for more information.

Note that Evolution is still pre-alpha. This means even if you manage
to compile and run it, you might not be able to figure out how to tell
it to accidentally delete all of your mail.

If you are interested in hacking on Evolution, you should subscribe to
the Evolution mailing list. Send mail to
"evolution-request@helixcode.com" with the word "subscribe" in the
body of the message. If you are planning to work on any part of
Evolution, please send mail to the mailing list first, to avoid
duplicated effort (and to make sure that you aren't basing your work
on interfaces that are expected to change).

There is a mailing list archive available at
http://lists.helixcode.com/archives/public/evolution/

There is also an #evolution IRC channel on irc.gnome.org.


Evolution depends on the following non-core GNOME libraries, which
are all in GNOME CVS under the given names. (If you build them in
the order they are listed, then the dependencies will all work out
correctly.)

	gnome-xml - currently, only 1.8.7 works. Earlier versions have
	a bug in code that Evolution needs, and the 2.0 branch is not
	source or binary compatible. If you get this from GNOME CVS,
	use the	tag "LIB_XML_1_X".

	gnome-print

	bonobo - Evolution always tracks the latest CVS versions of
	bonobo. Released versions will virtually always be too old.
	*** Note that this must be installed with the same --prefix as
	*** either gnome-libs or evolution for the Makefiles to work
	*** properly.

	gdk-pixbuf - 0.7.0 (or later?)

	gnome-vfs

	gtkhtml - Evolution might work with the released versions of
	this, but the CVS versions tend to be less buggy and more
	featureful.

	libglade

	libunicode

You also need a recent copy of ORBit. At the present time, the version
in Helix GNOME is the only released version that is new enough. If you
don't have that, you should check out ORBit from GNOME CVS with the
option "-r orbit-stable-0-5" to get the recent stable branch.

The Palm-synchronization code, when it is incorporated, will require
the pilot-link package. There is most likely a package for this in
your OS of choice (the name may be "pilot-link" or "libpisock"). If
not, you can get the source at ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/

You will most likely want to include the option
	--sysconfdir=`gnome-config --sysconfdir`
when configuring, to make the .gnorba files get installed into the
system gnorba directory. If you don't do that, you'll need to either
	a) set GNOME_PATH to include the prefix you install into
	   (eg, GNOME_PATH=/usr/local)     OR
	b) set GNOME_GNORBA_PATH to the gnorba directory in the
	   prefix you install into
	   (eg, GNOME_GNORBA_PATH=/usr/local/etc/CORBA/servers)



The layout of the source tree is:

addressbook:	the Address Book UI
calendar:	the Calendar UI
camel:		libcamel, a messaging library used by the mailer.
		Camel is inspired by Sun's JavaMail
		(http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/) and the
		IMAPv4 spec (RFC 2060).
wombat:		Has source code that will load in the addressbook
		and calendar backend, and will form the server
		process we'll be using
composer:	the message composer UI
data:		the .desktop file for Evolution
devel-docs:	entirely inadequate documentation
doc:		more inadequate documentation, and some nice white
		papers
e-util:		utility code used by various parts of Evolution
filter:		libfilter, a mail filtering library
libibex:	an indexing library used by the mailer
libical:	a library for the iCalendar format (RFC 2445-2446)
libversit:	a library for the vCard (RFC 2425-2426) and vCalendar
		(http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcal-10.txt) formats
mail:		the mail display UI
shell:		the Evolution shell (the main program that launches
		the other components)
tests:		some test programs
widgets:	widgets used by Evolution, including the shortcut bar,
		ETable, and EText
