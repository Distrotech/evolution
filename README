Evolution is the integrated mail, calendar and address book
distributed suite from Ximian, Inc.

See http://www.ximian.com/apps/evolution.php3 for more information.

Note that Evolution is still beta. This means it may delete all of
your mail if you give it the chance.

If you are using Evolution, you should subscribe to the Evolution
mailing list. If you are interested in hacking on it, you should
subscribe to the Evolution Hackers mailing list. Send mail to
"evolution-request@ximian.com" or
"evolution-hackers-request@ximian.com" with the word "subscribe" in
the body of the message. If you are planning to work on any part of
Evolution, please send mail to the mailing list first, to avoid
duplicated effort (and to make sure that you aren't basing your work
on interfaces that are expected to change).

There are mailing list archives available at
http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/evolution/     and

There is also an #evolution IRC channel on irc.gnome.org.


IF IT DOESN'T WORK
------------------

Did you read the "How to build" section below?

If the configure script complains that you don't have a library that
you know you have installed, it usually means either that you've
installed things into multiple prefixes (see the bits on GNOME_PATH
below) or (if you're on Linux) that you installed the "foo" package
but forgot the "foo-devel" or "foo-dev" packages.


HOW TO BUILD EVOLUTION
----------------------

	*** READ THIS BEFORE YOU START BUILDING ANYTHING! ***

Evolution depends on a large number of unreleased and rapidly-changing
libraries. Some of these libraries in turn depend on other unreleased
and rapidly-changing libraries.

Building Evolution is HARD, and it's going to stay hard until all of
the libraries it depends on stabilize, and there's nothing we can do
to make it any easier until then.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES
------------------

First you have to decide whether you want to install Evolution (and
its dependencies) into the same prefix as the rest of your GNOME
install, or into a new prefix. Installing everything into the same
prefix as the rest of your GNOME install will make it much easier to
build and run programs, and easier to switch between using packages
and building it yourself, but it may also make it harder to uninstall
later.

If you want to install into the same prefix as the rest of GNOME,
type:

	gnome-config --prefix
	gnome-config --sysconfdir

and remember the answers, and pass them to "configure" or "autogen.sh"
when building the other packages you need. For example:

	./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var/lib

    --localstatedir is needed to make the docs integrate with scrollkeeper
    and needs to point to the directory containing the scrollkeeper indices
    which are in: gnome-config --localstatedir

If you build in another prefix instead, you will need to set the
GNOME_PATH environment variable (and ACLOCAL_FLAGS as well if building
from CVS) to include the prefix you install into. For example:

        export GNOME_PATH=/usr/local
	export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/local/share/aclocal"

(Assuming your shell is bash, and you installed into /usr/local.) You
need to set GNOME_PATH both during compiling AND when you run
evolution. Remember also that if you're installing into an odd prefix
such as /evolution, that you also need to make sure to put
${prefix}/bin in your PATH and ${prefix}/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

The following required libraries are available in GNOME CVS, under the
given names.  Most (but not all) of them are also available as
tarballs on ftp.gnome.org.  The (*)ed packages are available in Ximian
GNOME ( http://www.ximian.com/desktop/ ).  Other packages may be
available from the Ximian GNOME evolution preview mirror.

If installing from packages, remember that you need both the runtime
and -devel packages for each library.

 - xml-i18n-tools - latest from xml-i18n-tools-stable-1-x branch in
   GNOME CVS (0.8.2 is too old)

 - scrollkeeper - 0.1.4 or later (*)

 - gnome-xml - 1.8.10 or later in the 1.0 series, but not from the 2.0
   series (If you get this from GNOME CVS, use the tag "LIB_XML_1_BRANCH".)
   (*)

 - gnome-print - 0.25 or later (*)

 - gdk-pixbuf - 0.9.0 or later (*)

 - ORBit - 0.5.8 or later (*) (If you get this from GNOME CVS, use the
   tag "orbit-stable-0-5".)

 - oaf - 0.6.2 or later (If you get this from GNOME CVS, use the tag
   "oaf-stable-0-6")

   *** If you are using oaf from CVS, you should use the flag
   *** "--disable-more-warnings" when configure, or it may fail to
   *** build.

 - gnome-vfs - 1.0.0 or later (If you get this from GNOME CVS, use
   the tag "gnome-vfs-1-0")

   *** If you are using gnome-vfs from CVS, you should use the flag
   *** "--disable-more-warnings" when configuring, or it may fail to
   *** build.

 - libglade - 0.14 or later

 - bonobo - 1.0.3 or later

   *** Note that bonobo must be installed with the same --prefix as
   *** either gnome-libs or evolution for the Makefiles to work
   *** properly.

 - gal (GNOME Application Library) - 0.18.1 or later

 - gtkhtml - later than 0.16.1

Other non-GNOME Dependencies:

 - Berkeley's libdb - 3.1.17

   db3 is available from http://www.sleepycat.com. Make sure to get
   3.1.17, it isn't the latest version.


COMPILING BERKELEY DB
---------------------

If you don't have 3.1.17 installed on your system or Evolution doesn't
detect it for some reason, here is a way to get Evolution to link to
it without messing up your system installation.

  * Get the Sleepycat tarball from:

      http://www.sleepycat.com/update/3.1.17/db-3.1.17.tar.gz

  * Install the content somewhere _other_ than the evolution source tree.
     e.g: NOT evolution/db-3.1.17

  * Compile according to instructions, but installing into some custom
    prefix, for example:

      ../dist/configure --prefix=/home/user/berkeleydb-3.1.17

  * Autogen Evolution specifying that it has to look for the DB
    library there, for example:

      ./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gnome
      --with-db3-includes=/home/user/berkeleydb-3.1.17/include
      --with-db3-libs=/home/user/berkeleydb-3.1.17/lib


COMPILING PALM PILOT SUPPORT
----------------------------

If you want support for PalmPilot syncing (currently experimental so
please back up your pilot) you will also need to do the following:

1) pilot-link 0.9.5
http://www.pilot-link.org

2) gnome-pilot 0.1.61
http://www.eskil.org/gnome-pilot/

3) evolution
In your evolution source directory do ./autogen.sh --prefix=<evo-prefix> 
--with-pisock=<pilot-link-prefix> --enable-pilot-conduits=yes
make
make install


SSL SUPPORT
-----------

If you want SSL support (and someday S/MIME), you will also need libnspr4 and
libnss3 which can be found at http://www.mozilla.org.

Once you have libnspr4 and libnss3 (and their respective includes) installed,
in your evolution source directory do:
./autogen.sh --prefix=<evo-prefix> --with-nspr-includes=<nspr-includes-prefix>
--with-nspr-libs=<nspr-libs-prefix> --with-nss-includes=<nss-includes-prefix>
--with-nss-libs=<nss-libs-prefix>

NEWSGROUP (NNTP) SUPPORT
------------------------

Experimental support for NNTP is enabled if you use the --enable-nntp
configure option, but it's currently unmaintained and highly unstable
and experimental.
