Two things are built in this directory: the shell's executable, named
`evolution', and the shell utility library, `libeshell'.

The `e-*' files belong to the shell, and their API is not exported at
all.

The `evolution-*' files, instead, are Bonobo-style wrappers for the
shell's Evolution:: CORBA interfaces.  They are all compiled into
`libeshell'; the shell itself links against `libeshell'.

The `evolution-*-client' files are utility GTK+-style wrappers for the
CORBA methods; the modules whose name does not end with `-client',
instead, are Bonobo-like GTK+ objects wrapping the implementation of
the CORBA server.
