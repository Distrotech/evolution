The files in this directory are used by Evolution's control center
capplet to automatically configure email accounts.  This so that you
can tell it, "My mail is example@gmail.com" and it will automatically
figure out that it must use imap.googlemail.com and smtp.googlemail.com.

These files are copied from
http://live.mozillamessaging.com/autoconfig/

We should update these files periodically, maybe.
