2000-02-16  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* tests/ui-tests/message-browser.c (tree_selection_changed): New
	callback function, which will later change the main html window to
	reflect the newly-selected tree item.
	(get_gtk_html_contents_window): New function. Gets the content
	part of a message.

	rather than changing it in place.
	(initialize_camel_formatter): New function; gives a root
	CamelDataWrapper and a stream to a CamelFormatter.
	(camel_formatter_wrapper_to_html): New function. Translates any
	CamelDataWrapper into html.
	(lookup_unique_id): Allows the root object to be a
	CamelDataWrapper, which is more general than the previously
	required CamelMimeMessage.

	-1 if we fail to load the file.
	(camel_stream_fs_new_with_name): If stream_fs->fd is -1, return
	NULL. These changes make it so that a CamelStreamFs won't be

	each time we want to add a new lib. 
	(bonobo, ....)

	* camel/camel.c (camel_init): only try to initialize threads if
	we enabled threads support. 

	* tests/ui-tests/Makefile.am (message_browser_LDADD): use
	EXTRA_GNOME_LIBS

	* camel/camel-mime-part.c (camel_mime_part_encoding_from_string):
	This was DEFINETLEY not the right way to do it. strncmp!=strcmp

	* widgets/shortcut-bar/e-icon-bar.c (e_icon_bar_recalc_item_positions):

	GnomeCanvas to work around a few bugs so that evolution will work
	well with old versions of gnome-libs.

	* widgets/Makefile.am: Added e-canvas.c and e-canvas.h.

	* addressbook/contact-editor/contact-editor.glade: Not much
	change.  Mostly internal reorganization by glade itself.

1999-08-17  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel/camel-stream.c (camel_stream_read): 
	return the number of bytes read. 
	How can this have ever worked ?
	(camel_stream_flush): don't return anything.

	* camel/gmime-utils.c (get_header_table_from_stream): 
	mem leak fixed.

1999-08-16  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* tests/ui-tests/store_listing.c:
	Now has a popup menu on mailbox tree to allow
	easier tests. Implemented the copy stuff.
	Works well for the MH provider :)))

	* camel/providers/MH/camel-mh-folder.c (_copy_message_to): 
	Test MH provider fast copy implemented.
	
	
1999-08-15  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel/camel-folder.c (camel_folder_expunge): 
	moved the active list readjustment code here.
	Much saner, providers won't have to worry about
	that.
	(_copy_message_to): new method.

	* camel/providers/MH/camel-mh-folder.c (_expunge): 
	no more active list readjustment stuff.

	* camel/camel-folder.h: the expunge virtual no more
	returns a list of expunged messages. Now providers
	only have to set the expunge flag on the expunged
	messages.

	* camel/camel-folder.c (camel_folder_get_message): 
	moved the caching code here. Finally, I don't want
	providers to crash the libs with a bad message cache
	implementation. 
	(_close): do not call the CamelFolder virtual expunge 
	method directly, use camel_folder_expunge() instead.
	(camel_folder_expunge): added the want_list param. 
	The client can decide if it wants the expunged message
	list or not. If yes, it'll have to unref the messages 
	itself.

1999-08-14  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* tests/ui-tests/store_listing.c (delete_selected_messages): 
	(expunge_selected_folders):

	* camel/camel-folder.c (_get_message): 
	Added some debug info.

	* camel/providers/MH/camel-mh-folder.c (_expunge): 
	implemented and tested.

	* camel/camel-mime-message.c (_set_flag): 
	changed the old braindead implementation.
	boolean are inserted in the flag hash 
	table casted as gpointers.
	

	* camel/camel-mime-message.c: indentation fix
	

1999-08-13  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel/camel-folder.c (_get_message): default implementation
	to be called first by providers methods. It looks in the
	folder message list (in memory) to see if the message has
	not already been retrieved, and in this case, returns 
	the same CamelMimeMessage object

	* camel/providers/MH/camel-mh-folder.c (_get_message): set
	message->message_number correctly.

	* camel/camel-folder.h (struct _CamelFolder): 
	New field (message_list) which will hold a 
	reference on each message obtained by the folder,
	which is necessary in order for the caching procedure
	to work (Getting the same message from a folder twice
	will return the same CamelMimeMessage object).
	
	* camel/camel-folder.c (camel_folder_get_message): 
	When the store retreives a message put it in its
	message list.
	(_finalize): free message list.

	* ChangeLog: fix typo (parmanent)

	* camel/camel-folder.c (_get_permanent_flag_list): 
	(camel_folder_get_permanent_flag_list): 
	new method, returns the list of permanent

	(camel_mime_message_get_flag_list): new method,
	return the list of flag name used by this message.

	(g_strcase_hash): those two func go here now.

	* camel/hash_table_utils.c (hash_table_generic_free): 
	free a (gpointer, gpointer) hash table pair.

	* camel/camel-mime-message.c (camel_mime_message_init): use
	case insensitive hash table functions. 
	(_set_flag): 
	(camel_mime_message_set_flag): 
	(_get_flag): 
	(camel_mime_message_get_flag): 
	Use const for flag name, they are now
	duplicated.

1999-08-12  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* tests/ui-tests/store_listing.c (show_folder_messages): 
	remove stupid debug code.
	(add_mail_store): use camel_session_get_store instead
	of creating MH store directly.
	(main): load MH provider.

	* camel/camel-provider.c (camel_provider_register_as_module): 
	register new provider.
	(camel_provider_get_for_protocol): 
	Now, implementation is correct.

	* camel/camel-store.c (_finalize): 
	* camel/camel-store.h (struct _CamelStore): 
	further disabled url_name field use. 
	URL will be generated dynamically.

	compilation and runtime fixes.

	* camel/providers/MH/camel-mh-store.c (_init): 
	synced with CamelStore.

	* camel/camel-store.c (_init): 
	in CamelStore::init, url_name is now const.
	disabled url_name copy.

	* camel/camel-session.c (camel_session_get_store): 
	new function: returns a store for an URL. 
	(camel_session_get_store_for_protocol): 
	new functionc: returns a store for a given 
	store protocol (as IMAP/POP/MH ...)
	* camel/string-utils.c (g_strcase_equal): 
	(g_strcase_hash): case insensitive hash table
	funcs.

	* camel/camel-session.c (camel_session_init): hash table
	keys are case insensitive.

	* camel/camel-provider.c (camel_provider_get_for_protocol): 
	new function, returns the last registered 
	provider for a protocol.

	* camel/providers/MH/camel-mh-provider.c: 
	new file. MH provider registration stuff.

	* camel/camel-provider.c (camel_provider_register_as_module): 
	load a provider from a shared object (plugin).
	(camel_provider_register): register a provider 
	"by hand". Used for statically defined providers.

	* tests/test7.c: new test.
	tests providers loading framework.

1999-08-08  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel/providers/MH/camel-mh-folder.c (_get_message):

	all static find_* func are now named _func_*  
	(g_url_free): destructor func.
	cache field has been disabled. Constructing the url string
	won't be too slow and will occur rarely enough that we
	do not need to add complexity to this code. 

	* camel/providers/MH/camel-mh-store.c: 
	parent class is CamelStorClass not GtkObjectClass

	content field to be freed (if necessary) and set
	to be a pointer to content_object mime type
	field. 
	(_construct_from_stream): set content_object mime type
	to be the same as mime_part's one. This is necessary
	because we use _set_content_type.

	should be in streams utils maybe. 

1999-07-29  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel/camel-mime-part.c (_construct_from_stream): 
	Uses data wrapper repository to find what data wrapper
	to use to construct the content from a stream. When 
	no object is registered for the mime type found in

	used. 
	
	* camel/camel-mime-part.c (_get_content_type): 
	(camel_mime_part_get_content_type): returns
