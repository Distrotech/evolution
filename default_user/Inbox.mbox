Welcome to Evolution 1.0: a developer's alpha preview. If you find a
bug, and you're running bug-buddy, you can submit bug-reports by going
to the file->bugbuddy menu (insert picture here).

TODO: fill out introduction a little more; make this into a pretty
html page to show off our html support; we should use a big dancing
monkey with light contrast as a background.
