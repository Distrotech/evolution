TODOs for libical-0.14
---------------------

libical treats properties with multiple values incorrecty -- it always
seperates multiple values into multiple properties. This is not
acceptable for CATEGORIES and RESOURCES.

Some TEXT valued properties, like METHOD, have a limited set of valid
values. The code should check that the values of these properites are
valid. ( Although METHOD now uses enums, and is not really TEXT valued )

For TEXT values properties with limited set of valid values, add
routines to use enums to set the values.

Finish implementing values
	ATTACH/BINARY
	content_type
	language

Check for buffer overflow on external input. 

Error Handling

   Dates and times: the parser will accept many illegal date time
   values

RECUR values ignore integers in BYDAY clauses
