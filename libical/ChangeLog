2001-01-19  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* src/libical/icalvalue.c.in (icalvalue_duration_as_ical_string): add
	-ve sign to output of duration if appropriate.
	(icalvalue_trigger_as_ical_string): implement.  not happy how this is
	done with the -1 for is_date trick but it will do for now and period
	does things in a similar way.

2000-12-21  JP Rosevear  <jpr@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icaltime.c: include configure.h because HAVE_TIMEZONE
	is used

	* acconfig.h: Terminate variable comment so that the variable can
	actually be seen

2000-12-15  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/Makefile.am: Build `libical-static.la'.

2000-12-14  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/Makefile.am (ical.h): 

2000-12-13  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icaltime.c (icaltime_from_timet): Use gmtime()
	unconditionally, since we want an UTC broken-down representation.
	(icaltime_as_timet): Add the offset only if the time was supposed
	to be in UTC; that way mktime() will get a proper localtime as
	source data.

2000-12-13  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icaltime.c (icaltime_from_timet): time_t values
	*are* in UTC by definition, so the is_utc argument is useless.
	Removed the conversion to UTC and made the icaltimetype.is_utc be
	TRUE always.  This breaks libical's owne internal use of this
	function, but since we do not use any of the functions that use it
	that way, we can ignore this.  This is basically a temporary
	measure until libical does the right thing.

2000-12-12  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalparser.c Addedd support for x-parameters. 

	* icalenum.c Fixed icalenum_parameter_type_to_string and
 	icalenum_property_type_to_string to property identify X- parameers
 	and properties.

	* icalparameter.c Fixed icalparameter_as_ical_string to property
 	write out X-Parameters.

	
2000-12-13  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalerror.h: Added a name to the parameter to
	icalerror_set_errno.

2000-12-13  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/Makefile.am (COMBINEDHEADERS): Removed the explicit
	paths.  Why it did *not* work on my original try when they were
	not there, well, now I don't know.

2000-12-13  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* src/libicalvcal/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add
	`$(top_builddir)/src/libical' to the include directory list.

	* src/libical/Makefile.am (icalparameter.h): Use `$(srcdir)'.
	(icalparameter.c): Likewise.
	(icalproperty.h): Likewise.
	(icalproperty.c): Likewise.
	(icalvalue.h): Likewise.
	(icalvalue.c): Likewise.
	(icalrestriction.c): Likewise.
	(CLEANFILES): Add `icalparameter.h', `icalparameter.c',
	`icalproperty.h', `icalproperty.c', `icalrestriction.c',
	`icalvalue.h', `icalvalue.c'.
	(COMBINEDHEADERS): `icalvalue.h', `icalparameter.h' and
	`icalproperty.h' are in builddir, not srcdir, so fix the list to
	use `$(top_builddir)' instead of `$(top_srcdir)'.
	(all): Removed.
	(BUILT_SOURCES): Move `ical.h' here instead.
	(ical.h): Don't depend on `(BUILT_SOURCES)'; this a built source
	itself.

2000-12-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalrecur.c: #if 0ed out some #if 1ed test code that
	was breaking my build by #including ical.h. No cookie!

2000-12-12  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* configure.in: Add a check for "extern int timezone;" vs struct
	tm tm_gmtoff, stolen from Evolution's configure.in.

	* src/libical/icaltime.c (icaltime_utc_offset,
	icaltime_local_utc_offset): Use HAVE_TIMEZONE, add tm_gmtoff
	support.

	* src/libical/icallexer.l: Remove ical_yy_scan_buffer, ..._string,
	and ..._bytes prototypes, since it compiles fine without them on
	Linux, and bombs out due to prototype mismatch on my NetBSD box.

2000-12-11  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.in: Disable compilation of the examples directory
	until libicalss is fixed.

	(COMBINEDHEADERS): Added paths to make "make distcheck" work.
	(libical_la_SOURCES): Added headers for distribution in our weird
	setup.

2000-12-11  JP Rosevear  <jpr@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icaltime.c (icaltime_compare_date_only): New
	function that compares only the dates, not the times as well.

	* src/libical/icaltime.h: Add prototype for the function above.

	* src/libical/icalrecur.h (struct icalrecurrencetype): Correct
	header documentation.

	* src/libical/icaltypes.c: No longer include <limits.h>.

	* src/libical/icalrecur.c: Likewise.

	* src/libical/icalvalue.c.in: Likewise.

	* src/libical/icalyacc.y: Likewise.

2000-11-21  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c Fixed a bug in the increment_* routines that made
 	incrementing by more then 1 insensible. Thanks to Martin Neimeier

2000-11-20  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalmessage.c Many routines to create new ical messages.

	* icalspanlist.c Code to generate a list of the busy time f the
 	VEVENTS in a set. Also includes routiens to generate free and busy
 	lists from the spanlist, and to find the next free time after a
 	given time.

	* icalvalue.c The STATUS property now has its own value type,
 	STATUS, which holds the enumeration icalproperty_status.

	* icalrestriction.c Added more restrictions. Now handles mutual
 	and exclusive consitions, and checks for the reight values in

	* icalcomponet.c Add sever get/set convienience routines to access
 	and manipulate common component propoerties from the component
 	interface. This eliminates the need to create a lot of temporary
 	variables if you just want to change the start time of and event.

2000-11-06 Eric Busboom    <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcomponent.c Added new routines to icalcomponent:
	_get_span -- returns the start and end times of the event in UTC
	_get_first_real_component -- return ref to VTODO, VEVENT or VJOURNAL

	* icalspanlist.c Added new class, icalspanlist, that generates a
 	list of alternating busy and free times from an icalset. The class
 	includes routines to gnerate rfc2445 busy and free lists, and to
 	get the next avaliable busy or free time after a given time.

2000-11-06  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalvalue.c (icalvalue_recur_as_ical_string): Handle
        both the position and weekday in the by_day field.

 	components: icalcomponent_new_vcalendar(), etc.

	* Makefile.am Incorporated build system patch from Federico
 	Quintero. Misc small fixes and cleanup

	* scripts Incorporated auto-gen patch from Frederico. Generated
 	code in libical now uses icalproperty.c.in (etc) instead of
 	editing file icalparoperty.c in place.

	* libical. Changed flex/bison to use the -P/-p options to set
 	ical_yy as a prefix. Removed prefix redefinition from icalyacc.y

2000-10-12 Eric Busboom    <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalproperty.c Fixed icalproperty_get_{first,next}_parameter to
 	honor the parameter kind argument

 	icalparameters_from_string that does not use the hairy nested
 	case/switch statements of the previous version

2000-10-11  Damon Chaplin  <damon@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalparameter.c (icalparameter_as_ical_string):
	(icalparameter_new_from_string):

2000-10-07  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalyacc.y (weekday_list): Fix the semicolons in
	this rule. Noticed by x-virge.

	* src/test/Makefile.in: While I'm here, remove this from CVS, as
	it's a generated file.

2000-10-02 Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* ical.h ical.h and icalss.h now are concatenations of all of the
 	public headers for their respective libraries. Thus, only ical.h,
 	icalss.h and icalvcal.h need to be installed.

2000-09-12  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* configure.in: AC_OUTPUT the Makefile in `src' before the stuff
	in its subdirs.

2000-08-25  Peter Williams  <peterw@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalcomponent.c (icalcomponent_end_component): Compile fix;
	use icalerror_check_arg_re so we can return an valid icalcompiter.

	* icalcomponent.h Added external iterators to icalcomponent for
 	subcomponents: icalcompiter. These are still experimental, but they
