	* examples/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): More `$(srcdir)' loving.

	* src/libicalvcal/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add `-I
	$(srcdir)/../libical' for builddir != srcdir loving.

2000-08-25  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* examples/access_properties_and_parameters.c,
	src/libicalvcal/vcc.y: Got rid of some warnings.

	* src/libicalvcal/vcc.c: Checking in generated C file.

2000-08-25  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalcomponent.c: Fixed an incorrect struct name.

2000-08-25  Peter Williams  <peterw@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalcomponent.c (icalcomponent_end_component): Compile fix;
	use icalerror_check_arg_re so we can return an valid icalcompiter.
	(icalcomponent_begin_component): Same.

2000-08-24  JP Rosevear  <jpr@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalvcal.h: Remove this duplicate file to fix build

2000-08-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* src/test/Makefile.am: Make it work.

2000-08-04    <eric@softwarestudio.org>
	
	* stow.c Changed stow to write data to a file ( icalfileset) not a
 	calendar. Also added MIME parsing capability

	* sspm.c Core of the mime processor. Now handles quoted-printable
 	and base64 encodings

	* icalmime.h New file that parses mime data and returns an
 	icalcomponent that includes all of the parts.

	
2000-07-26    <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaldirset.h misc bug fixes to get deleting components to work

	* icalcomponent.h Eliminated internal use of _get_first_component
 	and _get_next_component, since these will reset the interal
 	iterators.

2000-07-23    <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcomponent.h Added external iterators to icalcomponent for
 	subcomponents: icalcompiter. These are still experimental, but they
 	seem to work OK and have a nice syntax

2000-07-18    <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalset This is a new "superclass" for icalstore, icalcluster,
 	and others. It merges the interfaces of the old icalstore and
 	icalcluster

	* icalstore.{c,h} CHanged name to icaldirset

	* icalcluster.{c,h} Changed name to icalfileset
	

2000-06-12  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalstow.c misc improvements and bug fixes to make it useful.

2000-06-09  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c More extensive code changes for recurrence rule.

	* icalyacc.y Added support for integers in by day lists

2000-06-08  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* src/test/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Likewise.

	* src/libicalss/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Use $(srcdir) to allow
	builddir != srcdir.

2000-06-01  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c moved recur code into new files

2000-05-30  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaltypes.c Extensive work on code to expand recurences

	* icaltypes.h Changed signature icaltimetype_from_timet to include
 	is_utc flag.
	

2000-03-17  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalstore.c Vastly improved icalstore_test. 

2000-03-16  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcluster.c Added compile flag (ICAL_SAFESAVES) to switch how
 	icalcluster saves files during commits. When the flag is define,
 	it will write the data to a temorar file and rename the file to
 	the target file.

	* storage.c Added seterate test suite for sotage components

	* icalparser.c Created parser object, implemented line-oriented
 	parsering, and made message oriented parsing work in terms f line
 	oriented parsing.

	* icalparser.c Fixed icalparser_get_line to remove \r in input.
