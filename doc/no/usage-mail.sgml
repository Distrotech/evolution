  <title>Using Evolution for Email</title>
  <abstract>
    <title> A Guide to the Evolution Mailer</title>
    <para>
       <application>Evolution</application> email is like other email
       programs in all the ways that matter:
     <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
         <para>
           It can sort and organize your mail in a wide variety of ways with
           folders, searches, and filters.
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
          It can send and receive mail in HTML or as plain text, and
          makes it easy to send and recieve multiple file attachments.
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
           It supports multiple mail sources, including <glossterm
           linkend="imap">IMAP</glossterm>, <glossterm
           linkend="pop">POP3</glossterm>, local
           <systemitem><filename>mbox</filename></systemitem> and
           <systemitem><filename>mh</filename></systemitem> files, and
           even NNTP messages (newsgroups), which aren't technically
           email.
         </para>

	</listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      However, <application>Evolution</application> has some important
      differences.  First, it's built to handle very large amounts of
      mail without slowing down or crashing.  Both the <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link> functions
      were built for speed and efficiency on gargantuan volumes of
      mail. There's also the <application>Evolution</application>
      <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">Virtual
      Folder</link>, an advanced organizational feature not found in
      mainstream mail clients.  If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep
      every message you get in case you need to refer to it later,
      you'll find this feature especially useful.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="usage-mail-getnsend-read">
      <title>Reading Mail</title>
      <para>
       You can start reading email by clicking
       <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> in the shortcut bar. The first
       time you use <application>Evolution</application>, it will
       start with the <interface>Inbox</interface> open and show you a
       message from Ximian welcoming you to the application.
      </para>

      <para>
        Your <application>Evolution</application>
        <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> will look something like the one in
        <xref linkend="usage-mail-intro-fig">.
        If you find the <interface>view pane</interface> too small, you can resize
        the pane, enlarge the whole window, or double-click on the
        message in the <interface>message list</interface> to have it
        open in a new window.  To change the sizes of a pane, just click
        and hold on the divider between the two panes.  Then you can drag
        up and down to select the size of the panes.  Just like with
        folders, you can right-click on messages in the message list and
        get a menu of possible actions.

      The <guilabel>Email List</guilabel> displays all the emails that you

    <para>
      Most of the mail-related actions you'll want to perform are
      listed in the <guimenu>Message</guimenu> menu in the menu bar.
      The most frequently used ones, like
      <guimenuitem>Reply</guimenuitem> and
      <guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem>, also appear as buttons in
      the toolbar. Almost all of them are also located in the
      right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts, which tend to be
      faster once you get the hang of them.  You can choose whichever
      way you like best; the idea is that the software should work the
      way you want, rather than making you work the way the it does.

	the direction of the sort, and if you click again, you'll

	<guilabel>Date</guilabel> to sort messages by date from
	oldest to newest.  Click again, and
	<application>Evolution</application> sorts the list from

            The simplest way to direct a message is to put the email
            address or addresses in the <guilabel>To:</guilabel>
            field, which denotes primary recipients.  To send mail to
            more than one or two people, you can use the the
            <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> field.

            Hearkening back to the dark ages when people used
            typewriters and there were no copy machines, "Cc" stands
            for "Carbon Copy."  Use it whenever you want to share a
            message you've written to someone else.
          </para>
          <para>
            <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel> is a little more complex.  You
            use it like <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel>, but people on the
            <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel> list are hidden from the other
            recipients of the message. Use it to send mail to large
            groups of people, especially if they don't know each other
            or if privacy is a concern.

            <title>What is a Mailing List?</title>
            <para>
              Mailing Lists are one of the most popular tools for
              group collaboration on the Internet. Here's how they work: 
              <simplelist>
                <member>
                  Someone sends a message to a single address, like
                  <email>evolution@ximian.com</email>.
                </member>
                <member>
                  That address belongs to a program that distributes
                  the message to a list of recipients.
                </member>
             </simplelist>
               The mail management program lets individuals subscribe
               to or unsubscribe from the list at will, without
               requiring the message writers to remember the addresses
               of every recipient.
            </para>
            <para>
              Mailing list servers can also let network administrators
              control mail flow, list membership, and even moderate
              the content of mailing lists.

        <para>
          The post office forwards your mail for you when you change
          addresses, and you can forward a letter if it comes to you by mistake.
          The email <guilabel>Forward</guilabel> button
          works in much the same way.  It's particularly useful if you
          have received a message and you think someone else would
          like to see it.  You can forward a message as an attachment
          to a new message (this is the default) or
          you can send it <glossterm linkend="inline">inline</glossterm> as a quoted
          portion of the message you are sending.  Attachment
          forwarding is best if you want to send the full, unaltered
          message on to someone else.  Inline forwarding is best if
          you want to send portions of a message, or if you have a
          large number of comments on different sections of the
          message you are forwarding.  Remember to note from whom the
          message came, and where, if at all, you have removed or
          altered content.

      <para>
	Encryption is an ancient method of keeping information safe

	help you keep your private messages secret.  To do that, it
	makes use of the external application
	<application>gpg</application>, an implementation of strong

      </para>

	<note id="pub-priv">
	  <title>Public Key?  Private Key?  Whats the difference?</title>
	  <para>
	    GPG uses two keys: public and private.  You can give your
	    public key to anyone from whom you want to recieve
	    encrypted messages, or put it on a public key server so
	    that people can look it up before contacting you.
	    <emphasis>Never give your private key to anyone,
	    ever</emphasis>.  Your private key lets you decrypt any
	    message encrypted with your public key.
	  </para>
	</note>

      <para>
        Using encryption takes a bit of forethought.  When you send a
        message that is encrypted, you must encrypt it using your
        intended recipient's public key.  To <emphasis>get</emphasis>
        an encrypted message, you must make sure that the sender has
        your public key in advance.
      </para>

      <para>
	You can use encryption in two different ways:
        <simplelist>
          <member>
             Encrypt the entire message, so that nobody but the recipient can read it.
          </member>
          <member>
            Attach an encrypted signature to a plain text message, so
            that the recipient can read the message without decrypting it, and 
            only needs decryption to verify the sender's identity.

	    Kevin wants to send an encrypted message to his friend
	    Rachel.  He looks up her public key on a general key
	    server, and then tells
	    <application>Evolution</application> to encrypt the
	    message.  The message now reads "@#$23ui7yr87#@!48970fsd."
	    When the information gets to Rachel, she decrypts it using

             Now, GPG will generate your keys.  This may take awhile,
             so feel free to do something else while it's
             happening. In fact, using your computer for something
             else actually helps to generate better keys, because it

      </para>
      <para>
         GPG will create one list, or keyring, for your public keys
         and one for your private keys. All the public keys you know
         are stored in the file
         <filename>~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg</filename>. If you want to
         give other people your key, send them that file.
