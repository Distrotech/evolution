      <title> What is Evolution, and What Can It Do for Me?</title>
      <para>
        The idea of evolution as a process of improvement and
        development is a strong influence on the developers at Helix
        Code.  We named our <glossterm>groupware</glossterm> suite
        "Evolution" because we knew that it would be able to survive
        in the wilderness of the software marketplace for one reason:
        it's better.
      </para>
      <para>
        <application>Evolution</application> is a suite of groupware
        applications within the GNOME desktop environment that you can
        use to send, receive, and organize email, manage address and
        other contact information, and maintain a calendar.  It
        enables you to do those things on one or several computers,
        connected directly or over a network, for one person or for
        large groups.  <application>Evolution</application> can handle
        almost all your communications tasks with the power and
        flexibility of the GNOME desktop environment.
      </para>
      <para>
        We built <application>Evolution</application> with three groups of
        people in mind: everyday users, system administrators, and
        developers.  

        <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              For <emphasis>everyday users</emphasis>, we made
              <application>Evolution</application> easy to use without
              sacrificing power.  We made the interface familiar and
              intuitive, but also allowed users to customize it to
              their liking.  We made the setup and configuration as
              easy as possible.  For any confusion, we wrote a
              comprehensive manual and help system.
            </para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
               For <emphasis>administrators</emphasis>, we made sure
              <application>Evolution</application> met and and
              exceeded the standards set by currently available
              groupware products, and we developed support for most
              major network protocols so that it can integrate
              seamlessly with existing hardware and network
              environments.  All of our efforts have made
              <application>Evolution</application> both easy to use
              and easy to support.
            </para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
               For <emphasis>developers</emphasis>, we built in
               support for open standards and protocols to turn
               <application>Evolution</application> into an advanced
               development platform.  From the simplest scripting to
               the most complex network and component programming,
               <application>Evolution</application> offers developers
               the ideal environment for cutting-edge application
               development.
            </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
               For all three groups, we did our best to ensure the
               safety of data.
            </para>
          </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
        In action, <application>Evolution</application> makes most
        daily tasks faster, because we built it to work with you
        instead of against you.  For example, it takes only one or two
        clicks to enter an appointment or an address card sent to you
        by email, or to send email to a contact or appointment.
        <application>Evolution</application> makes displays faster and
        more efficient, so searches are faster and memory usage is
        lower.  People who get lots of mail will appreciate
        advanced features like <link
        linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">vFolders</link>, which
        let you save searches as though they were ordinary mail
        folders.

        This book is divided into two sections. The first section is
        a <link linkend="usage">guided tour</link>&mdash; it will
        explain how to use <application>Evolution</application>.  If
        you are new to <application>Evolution</application> or to
        groupware in general, this is the section for you. The second
        section, covering <link linkend="config">configuration</link>,
        is targeted at advanced users and administrators.  If you are
        a network administrator, you may find yourself referring to
        this section frequently.
