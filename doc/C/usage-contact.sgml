  <title>The Evolution Contact Manager</title>
  <abstract>
    <para>
      The <application>Evolution</application> contact manager can
      handle all of the functions of an address book, phone book, or
      Rolodex.  Of course, it's a lot easier to update
      <application>Evolution</application> than it is to change an
      actual paper book. <application>Evolution</application> also
      allows easy synchronization with hand-held and remote devices.
      Since <application>Evolution</application> supports most major
      network protocols, including <glossterm>LDAP</glossterm>, it can
      fit into almost any existing network.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another advantage of the <application>Evolution</application>
      address book is its integration with the rest of the
      application.  That means that when you look for someone's
      address, you can also see a history of appointments with that
      person.  Or, you can get an e-mail with contact information in
      it and create a new address card on the spot.  In addition,
      searches and folders and all work in the same way they do in the
      other components, so you don't have to learn another system for
      similar tasks.
    </para>
    <para>
      This chapter will cover using the
      <application>Evolution</application> contact manager to organize
      any amount of contact information, share addresses over a
      network, and several ways to save time with everyday tasks.  To
      learn about configuring the contact manager, see <xref
      linkend="config-prefs-contact">.

    <title>Getting Started With the Contact Manager</title>	
    
    <para>
       To open up your address book, click on
       <guibutton>Contacts</guibutton> in the shortcut bar.  The
       contact manager is illustrated in <xref
       linkend="usage-contact-fig">.  By default, the contact manager
       shows all your cards in alphabetical order, in a
       <glossterm>minicard</glossterm> format.  You can select other
       views from the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu, and adjust the
       width of the columns by clicking and dragging the grey column
       dividers.

       The toolbar for the address book is quite simple:
       <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
           Press <guibutton>New</guibutton> for a new contact.
	</para></listitem>

	    Press <guibutton>Print</guibutton> to print one or more cards.

        <listitem><para>
           <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> deletes a selected card.
        </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>

        </para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
       The last feature is <guilabel>Quick Search</guilabel>; to use
       it, just type in the name of the person you're looking for and
       hit <keycap>Enter</keycap>.
       <application>Evolution</application> will search through all
       the cards to find one that matches.
    </para>
    <para>
       If there are no matches, the card display will be blank. When
       you'd like to see all the cards again, press <guilabel>Show
       All</guilabel>.
    </para>
    <para>
       The rest of the contact manager is taken up by the display of
       your cards.  You can view that display as a table or as a list
       of cards&mdash; switch views in the <guimenu>View</guimenu>
       menu &mdash; and move through them alphabetically with the
       buttons and the scrollbar at the right of the window.

    <title>Destroy, Create, or Change Cards</title>

    <para>
       To delete a card, click on it once to select it, then press the
       <guibutton>Delete Card</guibutton> button.  If you have
       multiple cards selected, you'll delete multiple cards.
    </para>
    <para>
       Adding or changing cards is slightly more complicated.  Any
       time you add information to the contact manager, whether it's
       an old card you're editing or a new card you're just adding to
       your address book, you'll use the contact editor.  To change a
       card that already exists, just double click it to open the
       contact editor window with all the current information already
       filled in.  If you want to create a new one, clicking the
       <guibutton>New Card</guibutton> button will open up that same
       window, but with empty fields instead of full ones.  Either
       way, it's the same tool for quite similar tasks, and you'll
       find that it's pretty flexible and can store quite a lot more
       than you'd think would fit onto a file card.

      <para>
	The contact editor window has two tabs,
    	<guilabel>General</guilabel>, for basic contact information,
    	and <guilabel>Details</guilabel>, for a more specific
    	description of the person.  In addition, it contains a full
    	menu bar, covered in <xref linkend="menuref">.

        contacts, and a briefcase for categories.  You can guess what
        sort of information belongs in fields like <guilabel>Job

  <sect1 id="usage-contact-organize">
    <title>Organizing your Contact Manager</title>
    <para>
       Organizing your contact manager is a lot like organizing your
       mail.  You can have folders and searches the same way you can
       with mail, but the contact manager does not allow vFolders.  It
       does, however, allow each card to fall under several
       categories, and allow you to create your own categories.  To
       learn about categories, read <xref
       linkend="usage-contact-organize-group-category">.
    </para>

<!--
    <para>
      Another useful <application>Evolution</application> feature is
      its ability to recognize when people live or work together.  If
      several people in your contact manager share an address, and you
      change the address for one of them,
      <application>Evolution</application> will ask you if you wish to
      change the address for all of them, or just for one.
    </para>
-->

    <sect2 id="usage-contact-organize-group">
      <title>Groups of contacts</title>
      <para>
         <application>Evolution</application> offers two ways for you
         to organize your cards.  The first way is to use folders;
         this works the same way that mail folders do.  For more
         flexibility, you can also mark contacts as members of
         different categories.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-folder">
	<title>Grouping with Folders</title>
	<para>
	   The simplest way to group address cards is to use folders.
	   By default, cards start in the
	   <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> folder.  If you've read <xref
	   linkend="usage-mainwindow"> then you already know that you
	   can create a new folder by selecting 
           <menuchoice>
           <guimenu>File</guimenu>
	   <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu>
	   <guimenuitem>Folder</guimenuitem>
           </menuchoice>
           and that you can put new folders anywhere you like. Just
	   like with mail, cards must be in a card folder, and no card
	   can be in two places at once.  If you want more
	   flexibility, try <xref
	   linkend="usage-contact-organize-group-category">.
	 </para>
	<para>
          To put a card into a folder, just drag it there from the
          folder view.  Remember that contact cards can only go in
          contact folders, just like mail can only go in mail folders,
          and calendars in calendar folders.
         </para>
      </sect3>
      
      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-category">
	<title>Grouping with Categories</title>
	<para>
           The other way to group cards is to mark them as belonging
           to different categories.  The difference between folders
           and categories is that folders contain cards, but category
           membership is a property of each card.  That means that you
           can mark a card as being in several categories or no
           category at all.  For example, I put my friend Matthew's
           card in the "Business" category, because he works with me,
           the "Friends" category, because he's also my friend, and
           the "Frequent" category, because I call him all the time
           and can never remember his phone number.  
        </para>
	<para>
           To mark a card as belonging to a category, click the
           <guibutton>Categories</guibutton> button at the lower
           right.  From the dialog box that appears, you can check as
           many or as few categories as you like.
        </para>
	<para>
           Then, you can refer to all the cards in that category by:
           <!-- FIXME --> Waiting for Evolution to support the
           operation.
         </para>

       <!-- FIXME: Feature Not Implemented
	<para>

           If the master list of categories doesn't suit you, you can
           add your own.  Just enter the new category's name in the
           text box, then click <guibutton>Categories</guibutton> and
           choose <guilabel>Add to Master List</guilabel> in the
           window that appears. 
         </para>
       -->

  <sect1 id="usage-contact-sharing">
    <title>Sharing your Cards</title>
    <para>
       If you keep your cards on a network using an
       <glossterm>LDAP</glossterm> server, you can share access to
       them.  Actually, the server software takes care of that, and
       also determines who is allowed to see and change them.  This is
       the sort of feature you'll want to use if your company has a
       list of vendors and clients that needs constant updating.  If
       you also share your calendars, people can avoid duplicating
       work and keep up to date on developments within their work-group
       or across the entire company.
    </para>

     <example id="usage-contact-sharing-ex">
	<title>Sharing Address Cards and Calendar Data</title>
	  <para>
	    Ray wants to schedule a meeting with Company X, so he
	    checks the network for the Company X address card so he
	    knows whom to call there.  Since his company also shares
	    calendars, he then learns that his co-worker Deanna has
	    already scheduled a meeting with Company X next Thursday.
	    He can either go to the meeting himself or ask Deanna to
	    discuss his concerns for him.  Either way, he avoids
	    scheduling an extra meeting with Company X.
	 </para>
      </example>
    <para>
       Of course, you don't want to share all of your cards&mdash; why
       overload the network with a list of babysitters, or tell
       everyone in the office you're talking to new job prospects?  If
       you keep cards on your own computer, you can decide which items
       you want to make accessible to others.
    </para>
    <para>
       To learn how to set up your connection to an LDAP server, see
       <xref linkend="config-prefs-contact">.  Once you have a
       connection, the network contacts folder or folders will appear
       inside the <guilabel>External Directories</guilabel> folder in
       the folder bar, and will work exactly like a local folder of
       cards, with the following exceptions:
       <itemizedlist>

          <listitem><para>
              They are only available when you are connected to the network.  If 
              you use a laptop or have a modem connection, you may wish to copy or cache
              the network directory and then synchronize your copy with the networked version
              periodically.
          </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>
              To prevent excess network traffic,
              <application>Evolution</application> will not normally
              load the contents of LDAP folders immediately upon
              opening.  You must click <guilabel>Display
              All</guilabel> before LDAP folder cards will be loaded
              from the network. You can change this behavior in the
              <interface>Contact Preferences</interface> window.

	  <listitem><para>
              Your ability to view, change, add or delete
              contacts depends on the settings of the LDAP server.
              For example, you may read all the entries in the public
              Netcenter directory (available by default in the
              <guilabel>External Directories</guilabel> folder), but
              you may not change or delete any of them.
