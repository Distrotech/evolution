        To change your configuration settings, select
        <guimenuitem>Configure Camel Providers</guimenuitem> from the
        <guimenu>Tools</guimenu> menu.  This will open the
        preferences window, illustrated in <xref linkend="config-prefs-fig">.
        Preferences are seperated into several categories:

	    <para>
               <guilabel>Identity</guilabel>, which allows you to set
               your name, email address, and other information.  The
               default values are the ones found on your system account.
	    </para>

      <para>
         If you have only one email address, or use automatic
         forwarding to funnel multiple addresses into one, then you
         will only need to configure one identity. You may, however,
         want more thatn one.  To alter an identity, click on it in
         the <guilabel>Identity</guilabel> tab of the
         <interface>Preferences</interface> window, and then click
         <guibutton>Edit</guibutton>. To add a new identity, simply
         click <guibutton>Add</guibutton>.
      </para>

      <para>
         In either case, you'll be presented with a dialog box with

    <sect1 id="config-prefs-network">
      <title>Network Settings</title> 
      <para>
        In order to do much of anything with
        <application>Evolution</application>, you need to connect to
        your network.  To do that, you'll need to know your user name
        and password, what sort of mail sending and receiving
        protocols your network uses, and the names of the servers
        you'll be using.  If you're switching from another groupware
        or email progam, you can almost certainly use the same
        settings as you did with that program.  Select the
        <guibutton>Sources</guibutton> tab in the
        <interface>Preferences</interface> window to tell
        <application>Evolution</application> where you want to get
        your mail, and click <guibutton>Transports</guibutton> to
        determine how you want to send your mail.

              administrator will know which type of authentication
              your system requires.
              <application>Evolution</application> can also detect
              what sorts of authentication are available once it knows
              where to find the server.
