	      <listitem>
		<para>
	          If you have Ximian GNOME installed, you can start
	          Red Carpet, Ximian's software updating system, and
	          subscribe to the Evolution channel.  This will let
	          you install a binary for the latest release, and
	          will also warn you when a new version has been made
	          available.

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes, if you have Ximian GNOME installed.  Just run Red
	    Carpet and subscribe to the Evolution Snapshot channel.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    You can check the status of snapshots at <ulink

	<question>
	  <para>
	    Why isn't a new snapshot available today?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Sometimes the build might fail because of problems with
	    the source on CVS.  In this case, just wait for next day's
	    snapshot.

	<question>
	  <para>
	    How do I get Evolution from CVS?
          </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    If you already have <ulink
				       url="http://cvs.gnome.org">GNOME CVS</ulink> access,
	    simply check out the following modules: evolution,
	    gtkhtml, gal.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you don't have a CVS account, you can use anoncvs
	    instead. Bear in mind that anoncvs is only synchronized once
	    a day, and code received from anoncvs may not be latest
	    version available.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Before using the anoncvs server, you have to log into it.
	    This only needs to be done once. Use this command:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome login
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Then you can retrieve the modules needed to compile Evolution
	    using the following command:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co evolution gtkhtml gal
	  </programlisting>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    How should I compile Evolution avoiding conflicts with my
	    existing GNOME installation?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    The best way is to install Evolution into a separate prefix.
	    In order to specify a non-default installation prefix, you
	    can pass the <parameter>--prefix</parameter> option to
	    <filename>configure</filename> or
	    <filename>autogen.sh</filename>.  For example:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    cd /cvs/evolution
	    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gnome
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    If you install Evolution and the Evolution libraries in a
	    non-standard prefix, make sure you set the appropriate
	    environment variables in the startup script for Evolution:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    export PATH=/opt/gnome:$PATH
	    export GNOME_PATH=/opt/gnome:/usr
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    You may also need to add <filename>$prefix/lib</filename>
	    (e.g. <filename>/opt/gnome/lib</filename>) to your
	    <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>.  Of course, this will
	    not work for systems which do not use ld.so.conf, such as
	    HP-UX.

	    This actually means that Evolution cannot activate the HTML
	    editor component from GtkHTML.  The comments in the previous

	<question>
	  <para>
	    I updated my Evolution, but my addressbook contacts are no
	    longer there, what should I do?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Evolution uses the <filename>libdb</filename> library to
	    handle the addressbook database.  Two versions of
	    <filename>libdb</filename> can be used with Evolution: version
	    1.88 and version 2.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Unfortunately, an Evolution executable that is linked against
	    a certain version of <filename>libdb</filename> will only be
	    able to read addressbook files written by another Evolution
	    executable that is linked with the same version of the
	    library.  If your addressbook is not readable by Evolution
	    anymore, it probably means that you used to have Evolution
	    linked with a certain version of <filename>libdb</filename>,
	    but now it gets linked to a different version.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Because of the way <filename>libdb</filename> is designed, it
	    is not easy for Evolution to automatically do the conversion
	    between the two formats.  But, if your Evolution used to be
	    linked against version 1.85 and now is linked to version 2,
	    there is a very simple way to convert the database and recover
	    your data.
	  </para>

	  <itemizedlist>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		First of all, check the format of the database using the
		<command>file</command> command:
	      </para>

	      <programlisting>
                file ~/evolution/local/Contacts/addressbook.db
	      </programlisting>

	      <para>
		You want version 1.85 there.  If your version is 2, then
		your current Evolution is probably linked against
		version 1.85 and you cannot convert the database to the
		old format. To do that, follow these instructions:
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    
	    <listitem>
	      <para>

		Make a copy of the addressbook database for backup
		purposes.

		cd ~/evolution/local/Contacts
		cp addressbook.db addressbook.db.backup
	      </programlisting>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Convert the contacts to the new format using
		<command>db_dump185</command> and
		<command>db_load</command>:
	      </para>

	      <programlisting>
		db_dump185 ~/evolution/local/Contacts/addressbook.db.backup | db_load ~/evolution/local/Contacts/addressbook.db

	<question>
	  <para>
	    Evolution reported an error when trying to retrieve from my
	    local spool in <filename>/var/spool/mail/username</filename>.  Why?
    	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Evolution doesn't have an external helper for moving mail,
	    so <filename>/var/spool/mail/</filename> must be writable
	    by you.  Try this:
	  </para>
	  
	  <programlisting>
	    chmod 1777 /var/spool/mail
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Yes, we know this is a problem.  It will be fixed eventually.
	  </para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Evolution crashes reporting that it couldn't allocate N
	    billion bytes; how do I fix this?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    This usually happens when a component tries talking a
	    certain version of a CORBA interface to another component
	    that supports a different version.  For example, this can
	    happen when you recompile and install a single component
	    without recompiling/installing the rest of Evolution.
	  </para>

  	  <para>
	    So, if this occurs to you, make sure all the components
	    are compiled and installed at the same time.  This also
	    applies to GtkHTML upgrades; after upgrading and
	    installing a newer GtkHTML, always re-compile and
	    re-install Evolution against it.

	<question>
	  <para>
	    What is <command>killev</command> and why do I need to use it?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Evolution is actually made up of several components that run
	    as separate processes.  Evolution's shell is not very good
	    at cleaning up stale processes, so it is possible that
	    sometimes already-running components cause unexpected and/or
	    broken behavior.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    It's always a good idea to run <command>killev</command>
	    after a crash in Evolution, especially if the Evolution
	    shell itself crashed.  (If a component crashes instead, you
	    should try to exit the shell cleanly first, so you give a
	    chance to the other components to clean things up properly.)

	<question>
	  <para>
	    What is <command>oaf-slay</command> and why do I need to use it?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    <command>oaf-slay</command> is an utility which comes with
	    OAF, the Object Activation Framework that is used in the
	    GNOME Desktop to activate components.  It will kill the
	    object activation daemon (<command>oafd</command>) as well
	    as all the active components on the system.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Normally, you shouldn't need to run
	    <command>oaf-slay</command>, unless <command>oafd</command>
	    gets stuck or confused.  For example, it might help in case
	    Evolution cannot activate components.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Using <command>oaf-slay</command>
	    <command>oaf-slay</command> is quite drastic and can cause
	    problems with other programs that use oaf, especially with
	    <application>Nautilus</application>. To avoid problems, do
	    not run <command>oaf-slay</command> while you are in GNOME.

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    What is a stack trace (backtrace) and how do I get one?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    A stack trace is a list of the chain of function calls that
	    lead to some point in the program.  Typically, you want to
	    get a stack trace when Evolution crashes or hangs and you
	    want to try to figure out where in the code that happened
	    and why.  For this reason, stack traces are extremely
	    useful for the Evolution developers, so it's important that
	    you learn how to get them, and include them in crash
	    reports. Once we have <command>bug-buddy</command> working
	    with our bug database, it will be much easier to do
	    this. Until then, here's how:
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    First of all, in order to get a stack trace, your executable
	    (and possibly the libraries) must be compiled with debugging
	    symbols.  Debugging symbols are created by default if you
	    compile from CVS, and are included in the snapshot builds.
	    If you decide to compile by yourself with some custom CFLAGS
	    value, make sure <command>-g</command> is included in them.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Finally, you must put the component that crashes through
	    <command>gdb</command>.  Make sure all the components are
	    dead (exit Evolution and <command>killev</command>), then
	    run the following command:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    gdb name-of-component
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Then, at the gdb prompt, type <userinput>r</userinput> (for
	    "run") and wait a few seconds to make sure the component has
	    registered with the name service.  Then start Evolution
	    normally from a different terminal.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Then, reproduce the crash, and go back to the terminal where
	    you ran <command>gdb</command>.  If the component crashed,
	    you should have a prompt there; otherwise, just hit
	    <keycombo action=simul>
	      <keycap>Control</keycap>
	      <keycap>C</keycap>
	    </keycombo>.
	    At the prompt, type:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    info threads
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    This will give you a list of the current running threads,
	    e.g.
	  </para>

	  <screen>
	    (gdb) info threads
	    8 Thread 6151 (LWP 14908)  0x409778fe in sigsuspend () from /lib/libc.so.6

	    2 Thread 2049 (LWP 1003)  0x40a10d90 in poll () from /lib/libc.so.6
	    1 Thread 1024 (LWP 995)  0x40a10d90 in poll () from /lib/libc.so.6
	  </screen>

	  <para>
	    (Notice that, normally, only
	    <command>evolution-mail</command> will have more than one
	    thread.)
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Now, for each of the thread listed, type the following
	    commands:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    thread N
	    bt
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Where `N' is the thread number.  (In this example, you would
	    have to do it with N as 1, 2, 3... 8.)  Then cut and paste
	    all the output into some text file, and quit
	    <command>gdb</command> by typing
	    <userinput>quit</userinput>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    You can also get a stack trace from a running component or a
	    component that has just crashed.  Just start
	    <command>gdb</command> normally and, instead of using the
	    <userinput>r</userinput> command, use
	    <userinput>attach</userinput> to attach to the running
	    process:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    attach PID
	  </programlisting>

 	  <para>
	    Where <userinput>PID</userinput> is the PID of the
	    component.  Notice that this also works if you attach
	    right after a crash dialog appears, before hitting "OK" or
	    "Submit bug report".

	<question>
	  <para>
	    How can I remove a folder?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Currently there is no command in Evolution to remove a
	    folder, so you have to remove it by hand.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    All the folders are stored in
	    <filename>~/evolution/local</filename>.  Each folder is a
	    directory containing the data files, as well as a
	    <filename>subfolders</filename> directory that contains
	    all its subfolders.  So for example if you have a
	    subfolder of the <filename>Inbox</filename> called
	    <filename>Foo</filename>, you can run the following
	    command to get rid of it (and all it subfolders):
          </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    rm -rf ~/evolution/local/Inbox/subfolders/Foo
          </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    You should do this after exiting Evolution.

	    The implementation isn't finished, although it's planned

	    In the meantime, you can copy the folders' contents by
	    hand from the shell (please do this after quitting
	    Evolution).  For example:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
	    cp -r ~/evolution/local/Inbox/subfolders/Foo ~/evolution/local/Inbox/subfolders/Bar
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Likewise, you can use <command>mv</command> to rename or
	    move folders.

	    Can Evolution sync to my Palm OS (tm) device?

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  Evolution needs to be compiled with Palm syncing
	    support for this to work though.  Please refer to the
	    <filename>README</filename> file for additional
	    information on the requirements.

	<question>
	  <para>
	    What is the difference between a virtual folder (vfolder)
	    and a regular folder?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    A virtual folder is like a saved search: it is a view of
	    your mail. Regular folders actually contain the mail
	    messages.  You can have one message be in multiple virtual
	    folders, but only in one regular folder.  See the section
	    in the Evolution manual about virtual folders for more
	    information.

	  <para>
	    Can Evolution spell-check the messages while I compose them?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  The Evolution composer is able to highlight
	    mis-spelled word on the fly as you type them, and also
	    give you suggestions for possible corrections.  In order
	    for this to work you need the
	    <filename>gnome-spell</filename> component, which is not
	    shipped with Ximian GNOME yet.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If you are brave enough, you can check out module
	    <filename>gnome-spell</filename> from the GNOME CVS and
	    compile it yourself.  Check out its README file for a list
	    of <filename>gnome-spell</filename>'s requirements for
	    compilation.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Note that you don't need to recompile Evolution after
	    installing <filename>gnome-spell</filename>; it will be
	    picked up automatically.

	    I cannot see the images that are contained in some HTML

	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
  	    Evolution currently doesn't support this, but it's a
	    planned feature.  It will be an option: many people like
	    to turn off the images because they use up bandwidth and can
            be used to spy on your email reading habits.

	    You have to change the GtkHTML settings for that: in the

	  <para>
            How do I import my Outlook <filename>.pst</filename> files into Evolution?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
            You cannot import these files directly into Evolution
            because the <filename>.pst</filename> format is a
            proprietry format. However, Mozilla Mail on Windows can
            convert them into the <type>mbox</type> format, which can
            then be imported by Evolution.
          </para>
	  
	  <para>
            To start importing your Outlook mail to Evolution, run
            Mozilla Mail on Windows and select the
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Import...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
            to begin. Then select that you wish to import Mail from
            Outlook. Once Mozilla has imported all your mail, reboot
            your computer into Linux.
          </para>
	  
          <para>
            Mount your Windows partition in Linux and run Evolution to
            begin importing your mail. Select
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Import
		File...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to start importing. Set
            the file type to MBox (mbox) and click on
            <guibutton>Browse</guibutton> to select the mail you want
            to import.
          </para>
	  
          <para>
            If you are the only user on Windows, the mail files will
            be stored in <filename>/mnt/c/windows/Application
	      Data/Mozilla/Profiles/default/XXXX/Mail/imported.mail/</filename>
            where <filename>/mnt/c/</filename> is your windows
            partition mount point and XXXX is some collection of
            numbers and digits ending in <filename>.slt</filename>.
          </para>
	  
	  <para>
            If there is more than one user, the file will be in

            where USERNAME is your Windows username.
	  </para>

	  <para>
            For each mail folder in Outlook, Mozilla will convert the
            folder into one mbox file. To import all your mail, import
            all the files without a <filename>.msf</filename>
            extension.

            If Mozilla can import <filename>.pst</filename> files, why can't Evolution?

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Mozilla on Windows accesses the <filename>.pst</filename>
	    files through the <filename>MAPI.DLL</filename>, which is
	    only avaliable on Windows.  <filename>MAPI.DLL</filename>
	    is the only way to access <filename>.pst</filename> files
	    and Evolution cannot use this DLL in Linux.
