     <title>Setting up your synchronization system</title> 
     <para>
        Synchronization presents you with two issues you'll need to
        deal with.  The first one is pretty simple: you'll need to get
        the data to move among the various devices you're using.  If
        you've already got <application>Gnome-Pilot</application>
        working, then all you have to do is tell it to use Evolution
        as a conduit.  If you haven't used
        <application>Gnome-Pilot</application> before, you'll need to
        run the GNOME <application>Control Center</application> and go
        through the hand-held device setup assistant.  Then you can
        create the Evolution conduit and press the hotsync button.
      </para>
      <para>
        If that doesn't work, jump up and down several times and swear
        loudly.  Then make sure you've got
        <application>Gnome-Pilot</application> going to the right
        device (for my serial port, it's /dev/ttys0, not the default
        /dev/pilot) and that you have read and write permission on
        that device.  If you don't you'll need to be added to whatever
        group has those permissions (for my system, it's tty).
        Alternately, if you're the only user of your computer and
        don't care too much about security, just use
        <command>su</command> to become root, and then use
        <command>chmod a+rw /dev/[DEVICENAME]</command> to set
        universal read and write permissions on that port&mdash; just
        don't tell your sysadmin I said you could.  (Sysadmins, of
        course, would never do such a thing.)
     </para>
     <para>
        Once <application>Evolution</application> knows where to get
        the mail, address, and calendar data, it needs to know what to
        do with it.  When you synchronize your local data with the data on
        a server or handheld device, you may run into conflicts:
        perhaps you have ended up with two cards with the same name
        and different addresses, or old mail that has been deleted
        from one device but not the other.  What if you want to keep
        only the most recent mail on your hand-held or your laptop,
        but all the mail on the LDAP server or your desktop machine?
        Select the <guibutton>Synchronization</guibutton> tab from the
        <interface>Preferences</interface> window to set up the
        conflict resolution preferences.
     </para>
      <para> 
         You can set <application>Evolution</application>'s
         synchronization behavior in the following ways:

	    It's always a good idea to make a backup.  If you set your
	    synchronization behaviors wrong, you could end up deleting
	    the messages and cards you want to keep, and keeping the
	    ones you want to delete.  Before you change these
	    preferences, make a backup of your
	    <application>Evolution</application> files.  You can do
	    this by... <!--DESCRIBE HERE -->
