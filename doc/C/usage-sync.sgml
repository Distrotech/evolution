      <title>Synchronizing with a Hand-held Device</title>
      <para>
        Once you've set up a synchronization system, it pretty much
        takes care of itself.  Not only that, it's entirely possible
        that your system administrator has set it up for you.  All
        that this chapter covers is how to use that system once it's
        installed and configured.  If you need to set it up, consult
        <xref linkend="config-sync">.

        If you've already got Gnome-pilot set up to use
        <application>Evolution</application>, put
        your hand-held device on the cradle and press the HotSync
        button.
