           You can view your calendar by the day, by the week, by the
           month, or by the year.  To do so, click the buttons at the top
           of <application>Evolution</application> with the numbers 1, 5,
           7, 31 respectivly.
        </para>

           Describe the less-obvious differences among the views of
           time here.

	<para>
           In addition, <application>Evolution</application> supports
           Hebrew, Muslim, and other calendar formats.  To switch to a
           different calendar format, choose
           <guimenuitem>GUIMENUITEM</guimenuitem> from the
           <guimenu>GUIMENU</guimenu>.

	<title>Scheduling With the Evolution Calendar</title>
	<para>
	   The <application>Evolution</application> calendar allows
           you to schedule events for yourself or a group of people.
           It can handle events that repeat, event lengths from ten
           minutes to multiple days, and events that have a date but
           no specific time.  You can set overlapping events, although
           <application>Evolution</application> will warn you about
           trying to do two things at once.  You can also set event
           reminders so that you don't forget about everything you've
           just put into your calendar. Basically, it can handle almost
           any schedule you throw at it.

            While looking at the calendar, select <guimenuitem>New

            You can alter those settings later by clicking once on the

            Properties</guimenuitem> from the

            If you have your calendar set up to work with other
            calendars over a network, you can see when others are
            available to meet with you.  To browse other people's
            calendars over your local network, do this:

            In addition, you can use
            <application>Evolution</application> to mark a meeting
            request on another person's calendar.  To do so, first
            select <guimenuitem>New Appointment</guimenuitem> from the
            <guimenu>MENU</guimenu>, or press <keysym>KEYSYM</keysym>
            to bring up the <interface>new event</interface> window.
            Then describe the event as you would any other.  Before
            you click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>, (INSERT DESCRIPTION
            HERE...).  <application>Evolution</application> will
            automatically send email to each person on the request
            list, notifying of the time and date of the meeting you
            have requested with them.  In addition, it will mark the
            event on your calendar and on theirs as tentative, rather than 
            a confirmed, event.
          </para>
	  <para>
            To mark a tentative event as confirmed, click once on the

            select it, and then choose <guimenuitem>Event
            Properties</guimenuitem> from the
            <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu.  In the <interface>Event
            Properties</interface> dialog window, click the
            "tentative" button to un-mark the event. (NOTE THAT this
            feature may not at all exist!)

	 <title>Scheduling privileges</title>

            There are several levels of scheduling privileges.  You
            can set whether people can see your calendar, whether they
            can request meetings or appointments, and whether they can
            create appointments.  This section may have to be deleted,
            because I don't know if we are going to support privileges
            at all.
