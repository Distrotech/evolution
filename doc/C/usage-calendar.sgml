    To begin using the calendar, select
    <guibutton>Calendar</guibutton> from the <interface>shortcut
    bar</interface>.  By default, the calendar starts with a display
    of one day on a yellow ruled background.  There's a month calendar
    in the upper right and a To-do list in the lower right. The
    calendar's daily view is shown in <xref

    <title>Scheduling With the Evolution Calendar</title>
    <para>
       The <application>Evolution</application> calendar allows you to
       schedule events for yourself or a group of people.  It can
       handle events that repeat, event lengths from ten minutes to
       multiple days, and events that have a date but no specific
       time.  You can set overlapping events, although
       <application>Evolution</application> will warn you about trying
       to do two things at once.  You can also set event reminders so
       that you don't forget about everything you've just put into
       your calendar. Basically, it can handle almost any schedule you
       throw at it.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="usage-calendar-apts-basic">
      <title>Creating events</title>
      <para>
	To create a new calendar event, select
	<guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu> and then <guimenuitem>
	Appointment</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>MENU</guimenu>, or
	click the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button on the left end of
	the toolbar. The <interface>New Appointment</interface> dialog
	will pop up with the usual menu bar, tool bar, and window full
	of choices for you. I'm going to skip the the more
	self-explanatory items, like the <guilabel>Summary</guilabel>
	and <guilabel>Owner</guilabel> of the event (which is probably
	you), and cut right to the more intersting ones.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your event must have a starting and ending date &mdash; by
        default, it's today &mdash; but you can choose whether to give
        it starting and ending times or to mark it as an <guilabel>All
        day event</guilabel>.  For the purposes of the calendar, an
        <guilabel>All day event</guilabel> begins at ten in the
        morning, runs until eleven at night, and is displayed at the
        top of a day's event list rather than inside it.  This allows
        you to include events of shorter duration within it.  A
        conference might be an all day event, and the various lectures
        might be timed events that happen during the all day event.
      </para>
      <para>
         You can have as many as four different
         <guilabel>Alarms</guilabel>, any time prior to the event
         you've scheduled.  You can have one alarm of each type:

      <para>
         <guilabel>Classification</guilabel> is a little more
         complicated, and only applies to calendars on a
         network. <guilabel>Public</guilabel> is the default category,
         and a public even tcan be viewd by anyone on the calendar
         sharing network.  <guilabel>Private</guilabel> means
         (SOMETHING), and <guilabel>Confidential</guilabel> means that
         (SOMETHING ELSE).
      </para>
      <para>
        The <guilabel>Recurrence</guilabel> tab lets you describe
        repitition in events ranging from once every day up to once
        every 100 years.  You can then choose a time when repitition
        will stop, and, under <guilabel>Exceptions</guilabel>, pick
        individual days when the event will <emphasis>not</emphasis>
        recur.

      <para>
	Once you're done with all those settings, click on the disk
	icon in the toolbar.  That will save the event and close the
	event editor window. If you want, you can alter an event
	summary in the calendar view by clicking on it and typing. You
	can change other settings by clicking once on the event in the
	<interface>calendar view</interface> to select it, and then
	choosing <guimenuitem>Event Properties</guimenuitem> from the
	<guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu.

      <para>
	In addition, you can use
	<application>Evolution</application> to mark a meeting
	request on another person's calendar.  To do it, first
	select <guimenuitem>New Appointment</guimenuitem> from the
	<guimenu>MENU</guimenu>, or press <keysym>KEYSYM</keysym>
	to bring up the <interface>new event</interface> window.
	Then describe the event as you would any other.  Before
	you click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>, (INSERT DESCRIPTION
	HERE...).  <application>Evolution</application> will
	automatically send email to each person on the request
	list, notifying of the time and date of the meeting you
	have requested with them.  In addition, it will mark the
	event on your calendar and on theirs as tentative, rather than 
	a confirmed, event.
      </para>
      <para>
	To mark a tentative event as confirmed, click once on the
	event in the <interface>calendar view</interface> to
	select it, and then choose <guimenuitem>Event
	Properties</guimenuitem> from the
	<guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu.  In the <interface>Event
	Properties</interface> dialog window, click the

      <title>Scheduling privileges</title>
      <para>
	There are several levels of scheduling privileges.  You
	can set whether people can see your calendar, whether they

   <title>The To-Do List</title>
    <para>
       The to-do list, located in the lower right corner of the
       calendar, lets you keep a list of tasks seperate from your
       calendar events.  Tasks are colored by priority and due-date
       (see <xref linkend="config-prefs">), and are included with
       calendar data during synchronization with a hand-held device.

    <para>
       To record a new task, click the <guibutton>Add</guibutton>
       button below the list.  <application>Evolution</application>
       will pop up a small window with five items in it:
     
        <variablelist>

            Decide when this item is

       Once you've added a task to your to-do list, its summary
       appears in the <guilabel>Summary</guilabel> section of the
       calendar window.  To edit an item, double-click on it, or
       select it and click <guibutton>Edit</guibutton>.  You can
