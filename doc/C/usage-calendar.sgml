    To begin using the calendar, select
    <guibutton>Calendar</guibutton> from the <interface>shortcut
    bar</interface>.  By default, the calendar starts showing today's
    schedule on a grey and white ruled background.  At the upper
    right, there's a monthly calendar you can use to switch days.
    Below that, there's a <guilabel>TaskPad</guilabel>, where you can
    keep a sort of glorified to-do list that's not linked to your
    calendar.  The calendar's daily view is shown in <xref
    linkend="usage-calendar-fig">.

       You can view your calendar by the day, by the week, by the

    <title>Scheduling With the Evolution Calendar</title>
    <para>
       The <application>Evolution</application> calendar allows you to
       schedule events for yourself or a group of people.  It can
       handle events that repeat, event lengths from ten minutes to
       multiple days, and events that have a date but no specific
       time.  Of course, you can also set event reminders and alarms
       so that you don't forget about everything you've just put into
       your calendar. Basically, it can handle almost any schedule you
       throw at it.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="usage-calendar-apts-basic">
      <title>Creating events</title>
      <para>
	To create a new calendar event, select
        <menuchoice>
	  <guimenu>File</guimenu>
	  <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Appointment</guimenuitem>
	</menuchoice>
	or click the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button on the left end
	of the toolbar. The <interface>New Appointment</interface>
	dialog will pop up with the usual menu bar, tool bar, and
	window full of choices for you.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your event must have a starting and ending date &mdash; by
        default, today &mdash; but you can choose whether to give it
        starting and ending times or to mark it as an <guilabel>All
        day event</guilabel>.  For the purposes of the calendar, an
        <guilabel>All day event</guilabel> begins at ten in the
        morning, runs until eleven at night, and is displayed at the
        top of a day's event list rather than inside it.  That makes
        it easy to have events that overlap and fit inside each other.
        For example, a conference might be an all day event, and the
        meetings at the conference would be timed events.  Events with
        starting and ending times can also overlap, however, and when
        they do they're displayed as multiple columns in the day view
        of the calendar.

       <title>Doing Two Things At Once</title>
         <para>
           If you create two calendar events that overlap,
           <application>Evolution</application> will display them as
           multiple columns in the calendar window.  If you manage to
           do both things at once, I'd like to meet you.

        will stop, and, under <guilabel>Exceptions</guilabel>, pick
        individual days when the event will <emphasis>not</emphasis>
