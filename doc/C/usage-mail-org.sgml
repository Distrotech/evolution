    <para>
      Even if you only get a few email messages a day, you probably
      want to sort and organize them.  When you get a hundred a day
      and you want to refer to a message you received six weeks ago,
      you <emphasis>need</emphasis> to sort and organize them.
      Fortunately, <application>Evolution</application> has the tools
      to help you do it.

    <sect1 id="usage-mail-organize-columns">
      <title>Sorting Mail with Column Headers</title>
      <para>
         By default, the message list has columns with the following
         headings: an envelope icon indicating whether you have read
         or replied to a message (closed for unread, open for read,
         and open with an arrow on it to indicate you've sent a
         reply), an exclamation point indicating priority, and the
         <guilabel>From</guilabel>, <guilabel>Subject</guilabel>, and
         <guilabel>Date</guilabel> fields. You can change their order
         and remove them by dragging and dropping them.  You can add
         new ones with the <guimenuitem>Field Chooser</guimenuitem>
         item in the right click menu for the column headings.
      </para>
      <para>

      <title>Getting Organized with Folders</title>
      <para>
	<application>Evolution</application> keeps mail, as well as

	few, like <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel>,
	<guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Drafts</guilabel>,
	but you can create as many as you like.  Create new folders by
	selecting <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu> and then
	<guimenuitem>Folder</guimenuitem> from the
	<guimenu>File</guimenu> menu.
	<application>Evolution</application> will as you for the name

      </para>
      <para>
        When you click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>, your new folder will

      <title>Searching for Messages</title>
      <para>
	Most mail clients can search through your messages for you,

	body, or both body and subject.
      </para>
      <para>
	To start searching, enter a word or phrase in the text area

	    <term><guilabel>Body or subject contains:</guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This will search message subjects and the messages

	    <term><guilabel>Body does not contain:</guilabel></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This finds every email message that does not have the

        When you've entered your search phrase, press

        will show your search results in the message list.
      </para>

      <para>
         If you think you'll want to return to a search again, you can
         save it as a virtual folder by selecting <guilabel>Store
         Search as Virtual Folder</guilabel>.
      </para>

      <para>
         When you're done with the search, go back to seeing all your
         messages by choosing <guimenuitem>Show All</guimenuitem> from
         the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> drop-down box. If you're
         sneaky, just enter a blank search: since every message has at
         least one space in it, you'll see every message in the
         folder.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you'd like to perform a more complex search, open the
        advanced search dialog by selecting
        <guilabel>Advanced...</guilabel> from the
        <guilabel>Search</guilabel> drop-down menu.  Then, create your
        search criteria (each with the same options you saw in the
        regular search bar), and decide whether you want to find
        messages that match all of them, or messages that match even
        one. Then, click <guibutton>Search</guibutton> to go and find
        those messages.
     </para>

        You'll see a similar approach to sorting messages when you
        create filters and virtual folders in the next few sections.

    <sect1 id="usage-mail-organize-filters">
      <title>Staying organized: Mail Filters in Evolution</title>
      <para>
	Filters work very much like the mail room in a large company.
	Their purpose is to bundle, sort, and distribute mail to the
	various folders.  
        In addition, you can have multiple filters performing multiple
        actions that may effect the same message in several ways.  For
        example, your filters could put copies of one message into
        multiple folders, or keep a copy and send one to another
        person as well, and it can do that in under a second. Which is
        to say, it's faster and more flexible than an actual person
        with a pile of envelopes.
      </para>
      <para>
        Most often, you'll want to have
        <application>Evolution</application> put mail into different
        folders, but you can have it do almost anything you like.
        People who get lots of mail, or who often need to refer to old
        messages, find filters especially helpful, but they can greatly benefit
        anybody who gets more than a few messages a day.  To
        create a filter, open the <interface>filter
        assistant</interface> by selecting
	<menuchoice>
	  <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> 
          <guimenuitem>Mail Filters</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>.

      <para>
        The <interface>filter assistant</interface> window contains a
        list of your current filters, sorted by the order in which
        they are used.  From the drop-down box at the top of the
        window, choose <guilabel>Incoming</guilabel> to display
        filters for incoming mail, and <guilabel>Outgoing</guilabel>
        for those which sort only outgoing mail.
      </para>
      <para>
         The <interface>filter assistant</interface> also has a set of
         buttons:
        <itemizedlist>

           <listitem><para> <guibutton>Up</guibutton> &mdash; Move the
            selected filter up in the list so it gets applied first.

        If you don't have any filters set up, the only one of those
        buttons you can click is <guibutton>Add</guibutton>, which
        will open a dialog to let you add a filter rule.  If you do

	  should use the <guibutton>Filter by List</guibutton> instead of by

	      Kevin subscribes to bananas@ximian.com.  However, there is also
	      a bananas@ximian.org address.  If he used a regular
	      <guibutton>Filter by Sender</guibutton>, he would need to specify
	      one for each address.  However, <guibutton>Filter by

      <title>Getting Really Organized with Virtual Folders</title>
      <para>
	If filters aren't flexible enough for you, or you find
	yourself performing the same search again and again, consider
	a virtual folder. Virtual folders, or vFolders, are an
	advanced way of viewing your email messages within
	<application>Evolution</application>.  If you get a lot of
	mail or often forget where you put messages, virtual folders can help
	you stay on top of things.
      </para>
      <para>
	A virtual folder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational
	tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you
	set it up like a filter.  In other words, while a conventional
	folder actually contains messages, a virtual folder is a view of
	messages that may be in several different folders.  The
	messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of
	criteria you choose in advance.
      </para>

      <para>
	As messages that meet the virtual folder criteria arrive or are
	deleted, <application>Evolution</application> will
	automatically place them in and remove them from the
	virtual folder contents list.  When you delete a message, it gets
	erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as
	any virtual folders which display it.
      </para>

      <para>
	Imagine a business trying to keep track of mail from hundreds
	of vendors and clients, or a university with overlapping and
	changing groups of faculty, staff, administrators and
	students.  The more mail you need to organize, the less you
	can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an
	organizational system that's not flexible enough.  Virtual folders
	make for better organization because they can accept
	overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing
	systems can't.
      </para>

      <example id="usage-mail-organize-vFolders-ex">
	<title>Using Folders, Searches, and Virtual Folders</title>
	<para>
	   To organize my mail box, I set up a virtual folder for
	   emails from my friend and co-worker Anna.  I have another
	   one for messages that have "ximian.com" in the address and
	   "Evolution" in the subject line, so I can keep a record of
	   what people from work send me about
	   <application>Evolution</application>.  If Anna sends me a
	   message about anything other than Evolution, it only shows
	   up in the "Anna" folder. When Anna sends me mail about the
	   user interface for <application>Evolution</application>, I
	   can see that message both in the "Anna" virtual folder and
	   in the "Internal Evolution Discussion" virtual folder.
	</para>
      </example>

	<!--  (INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE: virtual folders in action) -->

      <para>
	 To create a virtual folder, select <menuchoice>
	 <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Virtual Folder
	 Editor</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  This will bring up a
	 dialog box that looks suspiciously like the filter window
	 (for more information on filters, see <xref
	 linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">), and which
	 presents you with a list of virtual folders you have previously
	 created. If you have created any virtual folders, they are listed
	 here, and you can select, edit or remove them if you wish.
	 If you have not created any, there will be only one available
	 option: click <guibutton>Add</guibutton> to add a new
	 Virtual Folder.
      </para>
      <para>
	 You can enter a name for your virtual folder in the
	 <guilabel>Name</guilabel>.  Then, tell
	 <application>Evolution</application> what messages to look
	 for.  This process is exactly like filter creation: decide
	 between <guilabel>Match all parts</guilabel> and
	 <guilabel>Match any part</guilabel>, then choose what part of
	 the message to look in, what sort of matching to perform, and
	 specify exactly what it is that you want to find, be it a
	 line of text, a score, a regular expression, or a particular date or
	 range of dates.
       </para>
       <para>
         The second part, however, is slightly different.  In the
         section of the window labelled <guilabel>Virtual Folder Sources
         </guilabel> is a list of folders in which
         <application>Evolution</application> will search for the
         contents of your vFolder.  Click <guibutton>Add</guibutton>
         to add a folder, or <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> to remove
         one.  That way, you can have your vFolder search in
         newsgroups, or just in one of your mailboxes, or just in a
         select few folders you've already screened with filters.

      <title>What is Encryption?</title>
      <para>
	Encryption is an ancient method of changing readable text to unreadable
	text that dates back to Egyptian times.  Encryption takes the statement
	"Evolution" and turns it into something which cannot be read without help
	through decryption.
	<example>
	  <title>Encryption Example</title>
	  <para>
	    Kevin orders an <application>Evolution</application> t-shirt from
	    Ximian, Inc. over the internet.  He puts in his credit card number
	    which is 1234-567-8901.  For security, his computer encrypts the
	    credit card number so it can be safely transmitted over the internet.
	    The number now is @#$23ui7yr87#@!48970fsd, which holds no intentional
	    resemblance to the inital number.  When the information gets to
	    Ximian, Inc. it'll be decrypted into the inital number.
	  </para>
	</example>
	Encryption can be used in email in two ways: to verify that the sender is
	the real sender, and to hide the message while in transmission.
	<application>Evolution</application> has the capability to do both.

      </tip>
      <para>
	You can start by typing in: <command>gpg --gen-key</command>.  At the
	first question, select 1.  The next question asks you about key length.
	The longer the key, more stronger it is.  However, the longer the key, the
	longer it takes to generate.  This is your choice.  However, 1024 bits
	(default) should be adequate.  The next question asks you if you want your
	key to expire.  Expiring keys make your key invalid after a certain amount
	of time, so old keys don't float around active.  This is the same concept
	as a coupon at a supermarket.  Next, you'll type in your Real name, your
	email address, and a comment.  You should not forge this information, as
	it is used later to verify who you are.  Assuming that all your
	information is correct, press "O" to continue.  GPG now asks you for a
	passphrase.  This is a password which you will need to decrypt and encrypt
	messages.  This can be any length, with any characters in it.  It is case
	sensitive, which means that it does know the difference between capital
	letters and lower-case.  Now your key is generated.  It is recommend you
	surf the internet, read your email, or write a letter in a word
	processor.  This help creates randomness in the key.

      <para>
	Once this is completed, you'll be dropped back to the command line.
