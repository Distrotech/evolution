      The Evolution Executive Summary is designed to show you a
      summary of important information: the appointments for a given
      day, important email, and so forth. To see your executive
      summary, click on the <guibutton>Executive Summary</guibutton>
      button in the shortcut bar, or select the
      <guilabel>executive-summary</guilabel> in the folder bar.

       The first thing you'll want to do with the executive summary is
       add a service. Click the <guibutton>Add Service</guibutton>
       button in the toolbar, then select one of the available
       services.

       Each service appears in a small box on the screen; you can
       remove the service by clicking the <guibutton>x</guibutton>
       button in the upper right, or bring up a settings dialog by
       clicking the little wrench icon below that.
