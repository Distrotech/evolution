  <para>
     Start <application>Evolution</application> by selecting
     <menuchoice><guimenu>Main Panel Menu</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Applications</guisubmenu>
     <guimenuitem>Evolution</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or by typing
     <command>evolution</command> at the command line.  The first time
     you run the program, it will create a directory called
     <filename>evolution</filename> in your home directory, where it
     will keep all your <application>Evolution</application>-related
     files.
   </para>
   <para>
     After <application>Evolution</application> starts
     up, you will see the <interface>main window</interface>, with the
     <interface>Inbox</interface> open.  It should look a lot like the
     picture in <xref linkend="usage-mainwindow-fig">. On the left of
     the <interface>main window</interface> is the <interface>shortcut
     bar</interface>, with several buttons in it.  Just underneath the
     title bar is a series of menus in the <interface>menu
     bar</interface>, and below that, the <interface>tool
     bar</interface> with buttons for different functions. The largest
     part of the <interface>main window</interface> is taken up by the
     actual <interface>Inbox</interface>, where messages are listed
     and displayed.  If you're running the program for the first time,
     you'll have just one message: a welcome from Helix Code.

      <title>The Way Evolution Looks</title>
      <para>
	The appearance of both <application>Evolution</application>
	and <application>GNOME</application> is very easy to
	customize, so your screen might not look like this picture.
	You might configure <application>Evolution</application> to
	start with a different view, without the <interface>shortcut
	bar</interface>, or with the <link
	linkend="usage-mainwindow-folderbar">folder bar</link>
	instead.

    <title>The Shortcut Bar</title>
    <para>
        <application>Evolution</application>'s most important job is
        to give you access to your information and help you use it
        quickly.  One way it does that is through the
        <interface>shortcut bar</interface>, the column on the left
        hand side of the main window.  The large buttons with names
        like <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> and
        <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> are the shortcuts, and you can
        select different groups of shortcuts by clicking the
        rectangular category buttons.
    </para>
    <para>
       The category buttons are <guibutton>Evolution
       Shortcuts</guibutton> and <guibutton>Internet
       Directories</guibutton>.  When you click on them, they'll slide
       up and down to give you access to different sorts of shortcuts.
       When you first start <application>Evolution</application>, you
       are looking at the <guilabel>Evolution Shortcuts</guilabel>
       category.  If you click <guilabel>Internet
       Directories</guilabel>, it will slide up and you'll see buttons
       for the <guilabel>Bigfoot</guilabel> and
       <guilabel>Netcenter</guilabel> directories, as well as any
       others you or your system administrator might have added.
       Internet directories behave a lot like the local contact
       manager, which is covered in <xref linkend="usage-contact">.
       </para>
    <para>
       Take a look at the <guilabel>Evolution Shortcuts</guilabel>
       again.  The shortcut buttons in that category are:

      If you don't like the shortcut bar, you can use keyboard

      next to their equivalent menu items in the menu bar. You can
      also set your own hot keys for functions that don't have any;
      this is covered in <xref linkend="config">.  If you're using the

       <title>Shortcut Bar Tricks</title>
       <para>
         To remove a shortcut from the shortcut bar, right-click on it
         and select <guimenuitem>Remove</guimenuitem>.  To add one,
         select <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu>
         <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu> <guimenuitem>Evolution Bar
         Shortcut</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>. </para>
       <para>
         To change the way the shortcut bar looks, right-click in an
         empoy space on the shortcut bar.  From the menu that appears,
         you can select icon sizes.
       </para>
       <para>
         You don't need the folder bar to move between folders. You
         can use <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Go
         to Folder...</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> to move to a
         particular foder.  It's faster, however, to click on the
         <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> label just below the toolbar, to
         the right of the shortcut bar, and select a folder from
         there.  The <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> label will change to
         reflect your location in the folder tree.

  <sect1 id="usage-mainwindow-folderbar">
    <title>The Folder Bar</title>
    <para>
      The <interface>folder bar</interface> is a more comprehensive
      way to view the information you've stored with
      <application>Evolution</application>. It displays all your
      appointments, address cards, and email in a tree that's a lot
      like a <glossterm>file tree</glossterm>&mdash; it starts small
      at the top, and branches downwards. On most computers, there
      will be three folders at the base.  The first one is
      <guilabel>VFolders</guilabel>, for virtual folders (discussed in
      <xref linkend="usage-mail-organize-vfolders">.  After that come
      any <glossterm>IMAP</glossterm> mail folders you might have
      available to you over your network.  The next folder is called
      <guilabel>External Directories</guilabel>, and holds
      <glossterm>LDAP</glossterm> contact directories stored on a
      network.  The most important one is probably
      <guilabel>Local</guilabel>, which you can use to access all the
      data that's stored on your computer.  If you click on the plus
      sign plus sign next to the <guilabel>Local</guilabel> folder,
      you'll see the contents:

       <guimenu>File</guimenu> <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu>
       <guimenuitem>Folder</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.  You'll be asked where you want to
       put it, and what kind of folder it should be.  You can choose
       from three types: <guilabel>Mail</guilabel>, for storing mail,
       <guilabel>Calendar</guilabel> for storing calendars, and
       <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> for storing contacts.
    </para>

    <note>
	  <title>Folders Have Limits</title>
	  <para>
	      You can always place a folder inside other folders,
	      regardless of folder type.  However, calendars,
	      contacts, and mail can't go into the same
	      folder. Calendars have to go in calendar folders, mail
	      in mail folders, and contacts in contact folders.
           </para>

    <para>
      Right-clicking will bring up a menu for just about anything
      in GNOME, and <application>Evolution</application> is no
      exception.  If you right-click on a folder, you'll have a
      menu with the following options:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><guimenuitem>View</guimenuitem>, to view a message.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><guimenuitem>Something else</guimenuitem>, for another purpose. </para></listitem>

     <title>Context-Sensitive Help</title>
      <para>
	GNOME 2.0 supports context-sensitive help, which means you can
	almost always get help on an item by right-clicking it.  If
	you're not sure what something is, or don't know what you can
	do with it, choosing <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem> from the
	right-click menu is a good way to find out.
      </para>
    </tip>

    <para>
      Any time new information arrives in a folder, that folder label
      is displayed in bold text.
    </para>
    <para>
      To delete a folder, right-click it and select
      <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem> from the menu that pops up.
      To change the order of folders, or put one inside another, use
      <glossterm>drag-and-drop</glossterm>.  To move individual
      messages, appointments, and address cards between folders, you
      can do the same thing: drag them where you want them, and
      they'll go.

      The <interface>menu bar</interface>'s contents will always
      provide all the possible actions for any given view of your

      items will relate to mail; some will relate to other components
