     Start <application>Evolution</application> by selecting
     <guimenuitem>Evolution</guimenuitem> from the
     <guisubmenu>Applications</guisubmenu> of the <guimenu>Main Panel
     Menu</guimenu>, or by typing <command>evolution</command> at the
     command-line.  After <application>Evolution</application> starts
     up, you will see the <interface>main window</interface>, with the
     <interface>Inbox</interface> open.  It should look a lot like the
     picture in <xref linkend="usage-mainwindow-fig">. On the left of
     the <interface>main window</interface> is the <interface>shortcut
     bar</interface>, with several buttons in it.  Just underneath the
     title bar is a series of menus in the <interface>menu
     bar</interface>, and below that, the <interface>tool
     bar</interface> with buttons for different functions. The largest
     part of the <interface>main window</interface> is taken up by the
     actual <interface>Inbox</interface>, with a listing of messages
     you have recieved.  If you're running the program for the first
     time, you'll just have one: a welcome message from Helix Code.

      <title>The Way Evolution Looks</title>
      <para>
	The appearance of both
	<application>Evolution</application> and
	<application>GNOME</application> is very easy to
	customize, so your screen might not look like this
	picture.  You might configure
	<application>Evolution</application> to start with a
	different view, or without the <interface>shortcut
	bar</interface> or <interface>folder view</interface>.

    <title>The Shortcut Bar</title>
    <para>
        One of <application>Evolution</application>'s most important
        job is to give you access to your information, and help you
        use it quickly.  One way it does that is through the
        <interface>shortcut bar</interface>, that column of buttons on
        the left hand side of the main window.  There are actually two
        kinds of buttons in the shortcut bar: familiar looking icons,
        and the thin rectangles at the top and bottom of the column
        which separate your shortcuts by category.
    </para>
    <para>
       The category buttons, labelled <guilabel>Evolution
       Shortcuts</guilabel> and <guilabel>Internet
       Directories</guilabel>, slide up and down when you click on
       them.  When you first start
       <application>Evolution</application>, you are lookig at the
       <guilabel>Evolution Shortcuts</guilabel>.  If you click
       <guilabel>Internet Directories</guilabel>, it will slide up and
       you'll see buttons for the <guilabel>Bigfoot</guilabel> and
       <guilabel>Netcenter</guilabel> directories, as well as any
       others you or your system administrator might have added.
       Click on <guibutton>Evolution Shortcuts</guibutton> to look at
       the shortcuts again.  Those buttons give you fast access to the
       major fucntions that <application>Evolution</application>
       provides for you.

      If you prefer to use a keyboard shortcut, or <glossterm>hot
      key</glossterm>, you can use those instead.  They're shown next
      to their equivalent menu items in the menu bar. You can also set
      your own hot keys for functions that don't have any; this is
      covered in <xref linkend="config">.  If you're using the
      keyboard shortcuts you may also want to hide the
      <interface>shortcut bar</interface> by selecting
      <guimenuitem>Hide/Show Shortcut Bar</guimenuitem> from the

    <title>The Folder View</title>
    <para>
      The <interface>folder view</interface> is the most comprehensive way to
      get to your information. It can show you everything you've
      stored with <application>Evolution</application>&mdash;
      appointments, address cards, emails, and so forth.

      The <interface>folder view</interface> display presents your
      data like a <glossterm>file tree</glossterm>&mdash; it
      starts small at the top, and branches downwards. There are a
      few folders you will always see, because they're at the top.
      On my computer, I have only one: <guilabel>Local</guilabel>.
      When I click on the plus sign next to the label, I see the
      contents:

    <para>
      Right-clicking will bring up a menu for just about anything
      in GNOME, and <application>Evolution</application> is no
      exception.  If you right-click on a folder, you'll have a
      menu with the following options:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Something</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Something</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Something</para></listitem>

    </para>

    <tip>
     <title>Context-Sensitive Help</title>
      <para>
	You can almost always get help on an item by
	right-clicking it.  If you're not sure what something is,
	or don't know what you can do with it, right-clicking and
	choosing <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem> is a good way to
	find out.
      </para>
    </tip>

    <para>
      If a folder has other folders in it, there will be a plus
      sign next to it. Click on the plus sign, and the folder will
      open to let you see the other folders inside.  This may
      change in the future to something more attractive, like
      triangles that drop down as you click on them to display the
      rest of the tree.
    </para>

    <para>
      Any time new information arrives in a folder, that folder
      will be highlighted, or its label displayed as bold
      text. You can learn more about customizing
      <application>Evolution</application> alerts and appearance
      in <xref linkend="config">.
    </para>

    <para>
      Moving and deleting folders and other items works in one of
      two ways: using <glossterm>drag-and-drop</glossterm> or by
      right-clicking and selecting an item from the
      <interface>right-click menu</interface>.  You can drag the
      folders inside the folder view to change their order or put
      one folder inside another.  To delete a folder, drag it into
      the trash folder or right-click it and select
      <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem> from the menu that pops
      up.  The same goes for individual messages, appointments,
      and address cards, whether they're in the <interface>folder
      view</interface> or not: drag them where you want them, and
      they will go there.  <!-- ****This paragraph could use some
      work**** -->
    </para>
    <para>
      You can also use the <guimenu>right-click menu</guimenu> to
      move, rename, and delete folders.
      <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem> function from the
      <guimenu>right-click menu</guimenu>.

  <sect1 id="usage-mainwindow-menubar">
    <title>The Menu Bar</title>
    <para>
      The <interface>menu bar</interface>'s contents will always
      provide all the possible actions for any view of your data.
      That means that, depending on the context, menu bar items will
      change.  If you're looking at your Inbox, most of the menu items
      will relate to mail; some will relate to other components of
      <application>Evolution</application> and some, especially those
      in the <guimenu>File Menu</guimenu> will relate to the
      application as a whole. You can probably guess that the
      <guimenu>Help Menu</guimenu> is where to go for help, and that
      the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu controls the way that
      <application>Evolution</application> looks.  Other menu items
      are a little less obvious, and change a little more, so we'll
      cover them later on as we discuss the things you can do with
      <application>Evolution</application>.

    <para>
      Once you've familiarized yourself with the <interface>main
      window</interface> you can start doing things with it.
      We'll start with your email inbox: you've got a letter
      waiting for you already.
