        Start <application>Evolution</application> by selecting

	<guisubmenu>Applications</guisubmenu> of the <guimenu>Main
	Panel Menu</guimenu>, or by typing
	<command>evolution</command> at the command-line.After
	<application>Evolution</application> starts up, you will see
	the <interface>main window</interface>, which looks a lot like
	in <xref linkend="usage-mainwindow-fig">. On the left of the
	<interface>main window</interface> are the <interface>shortcut
	bar</interface> and the <interface>tree-view</interface>.
	Just underneath the title bar is a series of menus in the
	<interface>menu bar</interface>, and below that, the
	<interface>tool bar</interface> with buttons for different
	functions. The largest part of the <interface>main
	window</interface> is taken up by a welcome message.  <!--

Make sure that this figure meets its descriptions below: it should
show the shortcut bar, the tree view with some trees expanded, and so
forth.  Can these things be labelled with little arrows & stuff?

	  <title>The Way Evolution Looks</title>
	  <para>
 	    The appearance of both
	    <application>Evolution</application> and
	    <application>GNOME</application> is very easy to
	    customize, so your screen might not look like this
	    picture.  You might configure
	    <application>Evolution</application> to start with a
	    different view, or without the <interface>shortcut
	    bar</interface> or <interface>tree view</interface>.

          keys for functions that don't have any; this is covered in
          <xref linkend="config">.  If you're using the keyboard
          shortcuts you may also want to hide the <interface>shortcut

	<title>The Tree View</title>
	<para>
          The <interface>tree view</interface> is the most comprehensive way to
          get to your information: it can show you everything you've
          stored with <application>Evolution</application>
          appointments, address cards, emails, and so forth.
        
          The <interface>tree view</interface> display presents your
          data like a <glossterm>file tree</glossterm>&mdash; it
          starts small at the top, and branches downwards. There are a
          few folders you will always see, because they're at the top.
          On my computer, they are: (ch. to itemizedlist w/descriptions?)
          <simplelist>
	    <member>Local Mail</member>
	    <member>Remote Mail</member>
	    <member>Address Book</member>
	    <member>Calendar</member>
	    <member>Trash</member>
	  </simplelist>.
        </para>

	<para>
          Right-clicking will bring up a menu for just about anything
          in GNOME, and <application>Evolution</application> is no
          exception.  If you right-click on a folder, you'll have a
          menu with the following options:
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem><para>Something</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Something</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Something</para></listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>.

	<tip>
         <title>Context-Sensitive Help</title>
	  <para>
            You can almost always get help on an item by
	    right-clicking it.  If you're not sure what something is,
	    or don't know what you can do with it, right-clicking and
	    choosing <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem> is a good way to
	    find out.
          </para>

	<para>
          If a folder has other folders in it, there will be a plus
          sign next to it. Click on the plus sign, and you will see
          the other folders inside.  This may change in the future to
          something more attractive, like triangles that drop down as
          you click on them to display the rest of the tree.
        </para>

	<para>
          Any time new information arrives in a folder, that folder
          will be highlighted, or its label displayed as bold
          text. You can learn more about customizing
          <application>Evolution</application> alerts and appearance
          in <xref linkend="config">.
        </para>

	<para>
          You can drag the folders inside the tree view to change
          their order or put one folder inside another.  To delete a
          folder, you can drag it into the trash folder.  The same
          goes for individual messages, appointments, and address
          cards, whether they're in the <interface>tree
          view</interface> or not: drag them where you want them, and
          they will go there.

          You can also use the <guimenu>right-click menu</guimenu> to
          move, rename, and delete folders.
          <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem> function from the
          <guimenu>right-click menu</guimenu>.

	<para>
          Once you've familiarized yourself with the <interface>main
          window</interface> you can start doing things with it.
