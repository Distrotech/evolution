    <title>Introduction</title> 

    <section> <title> What is Evolution?</title>
    <para>
      <application>Evolution</application> is a suite of groupware applications
      for mail, contact management, and calendaring.  It is
      included in the package <filename>Evolution</filename>, which is a
      part of the GNOME desktop environment. This document describes
      version &version; of <application>Evolution</application>
    </para>

    <para>
      What that means is that Evolution is your personal secretary.  It can keep track of 
      memos, emails,
      and appointments for you and for everyone in your office.
    </para>

    <para><application>Evolution</application> can be started by
        selecting <guimenuitem>Evolution</guimenuitem> from
        <guisubmenu>SUBMENU</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
	Menu</guimenu>, or by running the command
	<command>evolution</command> on the commandline.

       As was said before, <application>Evolution</application> can be
       used to send and recieve email, manage address and other contact information,
       and maintain  This section describes basic usage of
       <application>Evolution</application> in each of those functions.  As with most of Linux, 
       there's more than one way to do things, and you should pick whichever one strikes you as most
       appropriate.

     <title>The Evolution Mailer</title>
      <abstract>
       <para>
       This chapter covers the use of the Evolution Mailer. 
       Configuration of the mail client is discussed in <xref linkend="customization">.
       If you are already accustomed to other email programs, 
       you can probably skip the mail sending and checking sections. 
       The more complex functions, such as filtering, organizing, and searching mail,
        have some features that are not found in other email programs, and 
       even power users may wish to review these sections of the guide.
      <!--those function descr's should be xrefs to sections of the chapter-->
     </para>
      </abstract>

      <sect1 id="mailsending">
      <title>Sending and Recieving Mail</title>
       <para>
      You can start writing a new email message by selecting <guimenuitem>New Mail</guimenuitem> from
      the <guimenu>FilMenu</guimenu>, or by pressing <KeyCombo>NEW-MESSAGE-COMBO</KeyCombo>.  
      When you do so, the <interface>New Message</interface> window will open, as shown in 
      <xref linkend="evolution-newmsg">.

      </para>
     
     <para> 
      You can pick recipients in several ways: 
      The <guilabel>TO:</guilabel> field is for the primary recipients of the message your are going to send.
      It is considered bad form to have more than a few email addresses in this form.
      </para>
      <para>
      If you want to send a copy of the message to someone, you may also use the <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> field.  
      "Cc" stands for "Carbon Copy"-- Those people will recieve a copy of the message.  They will see
      the rest of the message list, and are noted as secondary recipients of the message. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
      If you have a large number of recipients, or if you want to send mail to several people without
      telling them that it's gone to multiple people, you should use <guilabel>BCC.</guilabel>  BCC stands 
      for "Blind Carbon Copy".  Addresses entered into this field will recieve the message
      but the message headers will not see the rest of the recipient list.
      </para>

      <para>
      Enter a subject into the <guilabel>Subject:</guilabel> field.

      Enter the text of your message into the <guilabel>Message:</guilabel> text area.
      </para>
      
      <para>
      If you want to attach a document to your email message, you can do so by
       <!--describe process here-->.  If the people you are sending a message to
       can read HTML mail, you can embed an image into the mail.  Otherwise,
       it's best to attach images, just like other documents.  Be aware that a large
       attachment will take a long time to download.
      </para>

      
      <para>
      Click <guibutton>Send</guibutton> or press <KeyCombo>SENDCOMBO</KeyCombo> to send the mail.
      </para>
    <tip> 
      <title>Send Now, Send Later</title>
      <para>
      Evolution will send mail immediately unless you set it to do so otherwise.  It also checks for 
      new mail every time you send mail.  If you
      want, however, you can queue your messages to be sent at a later time, and also set your
      preferences to check mail on a regular basis, and alert you whenever it finds new messages.
      I like  to use "Send Later" because it gives me a chance change my mind about a message
      before it goes out, and I have Evolution set to check my mail every ten minutes, and beep
      when I get mail that it thinks isn't spam.
      Use the <interface>Mail Preferences</interface> to specify message queue and filter behavior.  
      Preferences are discussed in <xref linkend="customization">.
      </para>
    </tip>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="mail-sorting">
    <title>Organizing Your Mail</title>

    <para>
    If you only get a few messages a day, you probably don't need to to sort or organize them.  When you get several hundred each day,
    and when you want to refer to a message you've recieved six weeks ago, you want a real
    organizing system.  This section will cover the mail sorting and organization: folders, searches, vFolders, and filters.
    <!--those last items should be links-->

    <sect2 id="mail_folders">
    <para>
    You can create new folders by selecting <guimenuitem>ITEM</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>MENU</guimenu>, or by
    pressing <KeyCombo>SENDCOMBO</KeyCombo>.  Move mail to them by selecting <guimenuitem>ITEM</guimenuitem> from the
    <guimenu>MENU</guimenu>, or by pressing <KeyCombo>SENDCOMBO</KeyCombo>.  An email message can be in only one folder at a time,
    just like real mail in real folders. If you forget where an email is, you can search for it. If you find that you want
    an email to be in several places at once, you should consider creating a vFolder, or virtual folder.
    <para>
    </sect2>    

    <sect2 id="mail_searching">
    <para>
    Because Evolution automatically creates an index of every email you recieve, it can search through your old
    messages and present you with the results in short order.  
    <!--describe the way one creates a search and so forth.-->    
    </para>

    <para>
    If you find yourself performing a search frequently, you can save it as vFolder.
    </para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="mail_vFolders">
    <para>
    Virtual Folders, or vFolders, are one of the more  advanced features of <application>Evolution</application>.  If they confuse you,
    you don't have to use them.  However, if you get a lot of mail, and find yourself referring to messages, looking for old email, 
    or just living in your email client, you'll probably want to use them. 
    Basically, a vFolder is a saved search, which you can access the same way you would a normmal folder.
    There are several important differences between the two, however, which come from the fact that  a conventional
    folder actually contains a message, but a virtual folder is really a different view of all your email.  This means that
    while a  message can be in several vFolders, it can be in only one conventional folder.  Also, 
    you cannot add or delete a message from a vFolder, and when you delete a message from a conventional folder,
    it will disappear from all your vFolders--a search can't find a deleted message.  
    </para>
    </sect2>

    <example><title>Using vFolders</title>
    <para>
    I have a vFolder set up for all the mail about a project I'm
    working on, and another one for all the mail from my friend Bernie.
    If Bernie sends me mail about the project, I can see that message both in the "Bernie" folder and in the "Project" folder.
    That's because when I open up the "Bernie" folder, I'm really performing a search for all the mail from Bernie, and when you open the 
    "Project" folder you're really performing a search for all the mail about the project.  That particular message 
    actually resides in some other folder,
    maybe just in my Inbox.  I can't delete it from the vFolder, because the vFolder is really a different view of my messages.
    When I delete it from
    the Inbox, I have also removed it from all my vFolders, because no search can find a deleted message.
    <!--this could use a cool picture of the Inbox and 2 vFolders with the message in all 3-->
    </para>
    </example>
    

    <sect2 id="mail_filters">
    <para>
    Filters sort your email for you, automatically.  You can access the Filter functions of
    the email client by <!--BLAH BLAH BLAH-->.
    </para>

    <para>    
    Email starts in your Inbox.  As it arrives, it is indexed and filtered from ther.  Any email
    that does not meet filter action criteria remains in the Inbox.   To create a filter,
     <!--open the menu somehow-->f you have filters enabled,
