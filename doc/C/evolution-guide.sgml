    <title>Using Evolution</title>
     <partintro>
      <para>
        Part one of the <application>Evolution</application> manual
        describes how to use <application>Evolution</application>
        for email, contact management, and appointment and task
        scheduling.  You'll find as you go along that, as with most of
        Linux, there's more than one way to do things, and you can
        pick whichever method you like best.

  <title>Configuring and Managing Evolution</title>
    <partintro>
      <para>
        <application>Evolution</application> is highly configurable.
        Usually, when developers say that, they mean that they didn't
        test it out thoroughly and have left it to other programmers
        to "configure" themselves a working system. In the case of
        <application>Evolution</application>, "configurable" means
        what it ought to.  It means that, while you can expect the
        program to work perfectly well in its default settings, it's
        also easy to alter its behavior in a wide variety of ways, so
        that it fits your needs exactly.  This part of the book will
        describe that process, from the quickest glimpse of the Setup
        Assistant to an in-depth tour of the preferences dialogs.
