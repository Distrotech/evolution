    <title> An Overview of the Evolution Mailer</title>
    <para>
       <application>Evolution</application> email is like other email
       programs in all the ways you would hope:
     <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It can sort and organize your mail in a wide variety of ways with
	   folders, searches, and filters.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	  It can send and recieve mail in HTML or as plain text, and
	  supports file attachments.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It supports multiple mail sources, including IMAP, POP3,
	   and local mbox files.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      However, <application>Evolution</application> has some important
      differences.  First, it's built to handle very large amounts of
      mail without slowing down or crashing.  Both the <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link> functions
      were built for speed and efficiency on gargantuan mail
      volumes. There's also the <application>Evolution</application>
      <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">vFolder</link>, an
      advanced organizational feature not found in other mail clients.
      If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep every message you get
      in case you need to refer to it later, you'll find that feature
      especially useful.
    </para>

    <para>
       You can start reading email by clicking
       <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> in the shortcut bar.  By
       default, the <interface>Inbox</interface> is open when you
       start <application>Evolution</application>, and the first
       time you see your inbox, there's a message in it from Helix
       Code welcoming you to the application.

      <title>Reading a Message</title>
      <para>
	The first time you open your
	<application>Evolution</application>
	<guilabel>Inbox</guilabel>, you will see a window like the one
	in <xref linkend="usage-mail-intro-fig">, with a message from
	Helix Code in the <interface>message list</interface>.  The
	message is displayed below that, in the <interface>view
	pane</interface>.  If you find the <interface>view
	pane</interface> too small, you can double-click on the
	message in the <interface>message list</interface> to have it
	open in a new window.  As is the case with folders, you can
	right-click on messages in the message list and get a menu of
	possible actions.
      </para>
      <para>
	Go ahead and click on the message in the <interface>message
	list</interface>.  That selects the message.  Then click on
	the <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button in the tool bar.  The
	message now has a line through it, because you've marked it
	for deletion.  If you really want to get rid of it, choose
	<guimenuitem>Expunge</guimenuitem> from the
	<guimenu>Tools</guimenu> menu.  That will delete it
	permanently. If you want to keep it, click
	<guibutton>Delete</guibutton> again, and it will no longer be
	marked as deleted.  At some point in the future, this feature
	will change to something a little less counter-intuitive.

	    In addition, you can mark recipients in three different
	    ways.  The <guilabel>To:</guilabel> field is for the
	    primary recipients of the message you are going to send.
	    However, it is considered bad form to have more than a few
	    email addresses in this section.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you're writing to one person, but want to keep a third
	    party up to date, you can use <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel>.
	    Hearkening back to the dark ages when people used
	    typewriters and there were no copy machines, "Cc" stands
	    for "Carbon Copy."  Use it whenever you want to share a
	    message you've written to someone else.
	    <example>
	      <title>Using the Cc: field</title>
	      <para>
	         Say, for example, Susan sends an email to a client.
	         She puts her co-worker, Tim, in the in the
	         <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> field, so that he know
	         what's going on.  The client can see that Tim also
	         recieved the message, and know that they can talk to
	         Tim about the message as well.
	      </para>
	    </example>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you have a large number of recipients, or if you want
	    to send mail to several people without sharing the
	    recipient list, you should use
	    <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel>. "Bcc" stands for "Blind Carbon
	    Copy", and means that people you put in the
	    <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel> field get the message, but
	    nobody else sees their email address.  They will still see
	    the list of addresses from the <guilabel>To:</guilabel>
	    and <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> fields.

	    <example id="ex-mail-bcc">
	      <title>Using the Bcc: field</title>
	      <para>
	         Tim is sending out a message to all of his company's
	         clients, some of whom are in competition with each
	         other, and all of whom value their privacy.  If he
	         puts every address from his address book's "Clients"
	         category into the <guilabel>To:</guilabel> or
	         <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> fields, he'll have made the
	         <emphasis>entire</emphasis> client list public.
	         Don't assume it won't happen to you; I got careless
	         one day and did it myself.

	   In order to reply to a message, click on it once in the

	   the subject will already be present&mdash; the same subject

	<title>Forwarding Mail</title>      
	<para>
	  The post office forwards your mail for you when you change
	  addresses, and you can forward mail when you get a letter by
	  mistake.  The email <guilabel>Forward</guilabel> command
	  works in much the same way.  It's particularly useful if you
	  have received a message and you think someone else would
	  like to see it.  You can forward a message as an attachment
	  to a new message (this is the default way of forwarding) or
	  you can send it <glossterm>inline</glossterm> as a quoted
	  portion of the message you are sending.  Attachment

      <title>Getting Really Organized with Virtual Folders</title>
      <para>
	If you find that filters aren't flexible enough for you, or
	end up performing the same search again and again, consider a
	virtual folder. Virtual folders, or vFolders, are an advanced
	way of viewing your email messages within
	<application>Evolution</application>.  If you get a lot of
	mail or often forget where you put messages, vFolders can help
	you stay on top of things.
      </para>
      <para>
	A vFolder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational
	tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you
	set it up like a filter.  Once you've set it up, you'll be
	able to open it and read the messages in it as though it were
	a normal mail folder.  It's not a folder, though, because when
	you open a vFolder, <application>Evolution</application>
	performs a search for you.  It's not a regular search, though,
	because you can build a vFolder with a very complicated set of
	criteria with multiple inclusions and exclusions, as though
	you were setting up a filter.
      </para>

<!-- potentially useful, but doesn't fit at the moment:
     <para>
       An important difference between a folder and a virtual folder
	is that a conventional folder actually contains messages, but
	a vFolder is a view of messages that may be in several
	different folders.  This means that while a message may fall
	into several vFolders, it can be in only one conventional
	folder.  Also, it means that you cannot remove a message from
	a vFolder unless you delete it, and you cannot add a message
	to a vFolder unless you change the vFolder's search criteria.
      </para>
-->

      <para>
	As messages that meet the vFolder criteria arrive or are
	deleted, <application>Evolution</application> will
	automatically place them in and and remove them from the
	vFolder contents list.  When you delete a message, it gets
	erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as
	any vFolders which include it.
      </para>
      <para>
	That's pretty complicated, but it can be useful. For example,
	if I have a folder for all the email from one person, and
	another folder for all the email on a given topic, I
	<emphasis>feel</emphasis> organized.  But when the person
	sends me mail about the topic, my whole email filing universe
	becomes chaotic, and I need vFolders to save the day for me.
      </para>
      <para>
	That sounds silly, but imagine a business trying to keep track
	of mail from hundreds of vendors and clients, or a university
	with overlapping and changing groups of faculty, staff,
	administrators and students.  The larger the system, the less
	you can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an
	organizational system that's not flexible enough.  vFolders
	make for better organization because they can accept
	overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing
	systems can't.
      </para>

      <example id="usage-mail-organize-vFolders-ex">
	<title>Using Folders, Searches, and vFolders</title>
	<para>
	   To organize my mail box, I can set up a vFolder
	   for emails from my friend Vince, by doing (INSERT
	   PROCESS HERE).  Then, whenever I want to see the
	   messages Vince has sent me, I open the vFolder, and
	   every message he's sent me shows up, no matter where
	   I've actually filed it.  If I want, I can also create a
	   vFolder containing any message from my list of
	   co-workers which also has the name of the project in
	   it.  That way, when Vince sends me mail about the
	   project, I can see that message both in the "Vince"
	   vFolder and in the "Project" vFolder.  That's because
	   when I open up the "Vince" folder, I'm really
	   performing a search for all the mail from Vince, and
	   when I open the "Project" folder I'm really performing
	   a search for all the mail about the project.
