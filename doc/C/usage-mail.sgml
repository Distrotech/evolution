    <title> A Guide to the Evolution Mailer</title>
    <para>
       <application>Evolution</application> email is like other email
       programs in all the ways you would hope:
     <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
         <para>
           It can sort and organize your mail in a wide variety of ways with
           folders, searches, and filters.
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
          It can send and receive mail in HTML or as plain text, and
          permits multiple file attachments.
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
           It supports multiple mail sources, including <glossterm
           linkend="imap">IMAP</glossterm>, <glossterm
           linkend="pop">POP3</glossterm>, local
           <systemitem><filename>mbox</filename></systemitem> and
           <systemitem><filename>mh</filename></systemitem> files, and
           even NNTP messages (newsgroups), which aren't technically
           email.
         </para>
       </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      However, <application>Evolution</application> has some important
      differences.  First, it's built to handle very large amounts of
      mail without slowing down or crashing.  Both the <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link> functions
      were built for speed and efficiency on gargantuan volumes of
      mail. There's also the <application>Evolution</application>
      <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">Virtual
      Folder</link>, an advanced organizational feature not found in
      many other mail clients.  If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep
      every message you get in case you need to refer to it later,
      you'll find this feature especially useful.

    <sect2 id="usage-mail-getnsend-read">
      <title>Reading Mail</title>
      <para>
       You can start reading email by clicking
       <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> in the shortcut bar. The first
       time you use <application>Evolution</application>, it will
       start with the <interface>Inbox</interface> open and show you a
       message from Ximian welcoming you to the application.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your <application>Evolution</application>
        <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> will look something like the one in
        <xref linkend="usage-mail-intro-fig">.
        If you find the <interface>view pane</interface> too small, you can resize
        the pane, enlarge the whole window, or double-click on the
        message in the <interface>message list</interface> to have it
        open in a new window.  To change the sizes of a pane, just click
        and hold on the divider between the two panes.  Then you can drag
        up and down to select the size of the panes.  Just like with
        folders, you can right-click on messages in the message list and
        get a menu of possible actions.

      </para>

      <para>
        The <guilabel>Email List</guilabel> lists off all the emails that you
        have.  This includes all your read, unread, and email that is flagged to        be deleted.
      </para>

      <para>
        Most of the mail-related actions you'll want to perform are
        listed in the <guimenu>Message</guimenu> menu in the menu
        bar.  The most frequently used ones, like
        <guimenuitem>Reply</guimenuitem> and
        <guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem>, also appear as buttons in
         the toolbar, and almost all of them are duplicated in the
        right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts, which tend to be
        faster once you get the hang of them.  You can choose
        whichever way you like best; the idea is that the software
        should work the way you want, rather than making you work the
        way the it does.

        <para>
          One of the ways <application>Evolution</application> lets
          you choose the way you work is the way it lets you sort your
          message lists.  To sort by sender, subject, or date, click
          on the bars with those labels at the top of the message
          list. The direction of the arrow next to the label indicates
          the direction of the sort, and if you click again, you'll
          sort them in reverse order. For example, click once on
          <guilabel>Date</guilabel> to sort messages by date from
          oldest to newest.  Click again, and
          <application>Evolution</application> sorts the list from
          newest to oldest. You can also right-click on the message
          header bars to get a set of sorting options, and add or
          remove columns from the message list.  You can find detailed
          instructions on how to customize your message display
          columns in <xref linkend="usage-mail-organize-columns">.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can also choose a threaded message view. Select
          <menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Threaded</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> to turn
          the threaded view on or off.  When you select this option,
          <application>Evolution</application> groups the replies to a
          message with the original, so you can follow the thread of a
          conversation from one message to the next.

          Once you've read your mail, you may want to get rid of
          it. To mark a message for deletion, select it in the the
          <interface>message list</interface> by clicking on it once.
          Then click on the <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button in
          the tool bar. Or, right-click on a message and choose
          <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem> from the right-click
          menu. The message will appear with a line through it, to
          show that you've marked it for deletion.

          <guimenuitem>Expunge</guimenuitem> from the

        Now that you've had a look around the
        <interface>Inbox</interface>, it's time to check for new mail.
        Click <guibutton>Get mail</guibutton> in the toolbar to check
        your mail.  If it's the first time you've done so, the
        <interface>mail setup assistant</interface> will ask you for

      <para>
        Once it's validated the password,
        <application>Evolution</application> will check your mail.
        New mail will appear in the local <interface>Inbox</interface>
        if you're using a <glossterm>POP</glossterm> account, and in
        your <glossterm>IMAP</glossterm> folders if you use IMAP.  If
        you have chosen to use IMAP, and you have multiple folders on

         Newsgroups are so similar to email that there's no reason not
         to read them side by side.  If you want to do that, add a
         news source to your configuration (see <xref
         linkend="config-prefs-network-news">). The news server will
         appear as a remote server, and will look quite similar to an
         IMAP folder.  When you click <guibutton>Get Mail</guibutton>,
         <application>Evolution</application> will also check for news

          <application>Evolution</application> will display the file

            <title>Whats a Mailing List?</title>
            <para>
              Mailing Lists are one of the most popular ways in which group
              collaboration on the internet works.  They allow people to send one
              message to one server.  The server then knows who is subscribed to the
              mailing list, and sends a copy of your email to all the people on the
              list.  As a matter of fact, mailing lists are one of the main ways in
              which <application>Evolution</application> was developed.
            </para>
            <para>
              There are two different types of mailing lists.  The first is a
              general submission list.  That means that anyone can write to the
              list.  The second is a managed list.  The managed lists have
              someone running them.  They can do as little as limit who
              subscribes to the list or as much as moderate which emails get on
              the list.

          you can send it <glossterm linkend="inline">inline</glossterm> as a quoted
          portion of the message you are sending.  Attachment
          forwarding is best if you want to send the full, unaltered
          message on to someone else.  Inline forwarding is best if
          you want to send portions of a message, or if you have a
          large number of comments on different sections of the
          message you are forwarding.  Remember to note from whom the
          message came, and where, if at all, you have removed or
          altered content.

          To forward a message you are reading, press
          <guibutton>Forward</guibutton> on the toolbar, or select
          <menuchoice> <guimenu>Message</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  If you
          prefer to forward the message <glossterm linkend="inline">inline</glossterm>
          instead of attached, select <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Forward
          Inline</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> from the menu.  Choose an
          addressee as you would when sending a new message; the
          subject will already be entered, but you can alter it.
          Enter your comments on the message in the
          <interface>composition frame</interface>, and press
          <guibutton>Send</guibutton>.

                 Don't send spam or forward chain mail.  If you must,
                 watch out for hoaxes and urban legends, and make sure
                 the message doesn't have multiple layers of
                 greater-than signs, (&gt;) indicating multiple layers
                 of careless in-line forwarding.

                Always begin and close with a salutation. Say "please"
                and "thank you," just like you do in real life. You
                can keep your pleasantries short, but be pleasant!
