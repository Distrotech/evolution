    <para>
       <application>Evolution</application> email is like other email
       programs in all the ways that matter:
     <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
         <para>
           It can sort and organize your mail in a wide variety of ways with
           folders, searches, and filters.
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
          It can send and receive mail in HTML or as plain text, and
          makes it easy to send and recieve multiple file attachments.
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
           It supports multiple mail sources, including <glossterm
           linkend="imap">IMAP</glossterm>, <glossterm
           linkend="pop">POP3</glossterm>, local
           <systemitem><filename>mbox</filename></systemitem> and
           <systemitem><filename>mh</filename></systemitem> files, and
           even NNTP messages (newsgroups), which aren't technically
           email.

    <para>
      However, <application>Evolution</application> has some important
      differences.  First, it's built to handle very large amounts of
      mail without slowing down or crashing.  Both the <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link> functions
      were built for speed and efficiency on gargantuan volumes of
      mail. There's also the <application>Evolution</application>
      <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">Virtual
      Folder</link>, an advanced organizational feature not found in
      mainstream mail clients.  If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep
      every message you get in case you need to refer to it later,
      you'll find this feature especially useful.

      <title>Reading Mail</title>
      <para>
       You can start reading email by clicking
       <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> in the shortcut bar. The first
       time you use <application>Evolution</application>, it will
       start with the <interface>Inbox</interface> open and show you a
       message from Ximian welcoming you to the application.
      </para>

      <para>
        Your <application>Evolution</application>
        <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> will look something like the one in
        <xref linkend="usage-mail-intro-fig">.
        If you find the <interface>view pane</interface> too small, you can resize
        the pane, enlarge the whole window, or double-click on the
        message in the <interface>message list</interface> to have it
        open in a new window.  To change the sizes of a pane, just click
        and hold on the divider between the two panes.  Then you can drag
        up and down to select the size of the panes.  Just like with
        folders, you can right-click on messages in the message list and
        get a menu of possible actions.

    <para>
      Most of the mail-related actions you'll want to perform are
      listed in the <guimenu>Message</guimenu> menu in the menu
      bar.  The most frequently used ones, like
      <guimenuitem>Reply</guimenuitem> and
      <guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem>, also appear as buttons in
      the toolbar. Almost all of them are also located in the
      right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts, which tend to be
      faster once you get the hang of them.  You can choose
      whichever way you like best; the idea is that the software
      should work the way you want, rather than making you work the
      way the it does.

	the direction of the sort, and if you click again, you'll

	<application>Evolution</application> sorts the list from

                 Tim is sending an email announcement to all of his
                 company's clients, some of whom are in competition
                 with each other, and all of whom value their
                 privacy. He needs to use the
                 <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel> field here.  If he puts
                 every address from his address book's "Clients"
                 category into the <guilabel>To:</guilabel> or
                 <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> fields, he'll make the
                 company's <emphasis>entire</emphasis> client list
                 public. But putting his "Clients" addressbook
                 into the Bcc: section, that will cause them to be hidden
                 from the competition.  It seems insignificant, but it can
                 make a huge difference in some situations.

            <title>What is a Mailing List?</title>
            <para>
              Mailing Lists are one of the most popular ways in which group
              collaboration on the Internet works.  They allow people to send one
              message to one server.  The server then knows who is subscribed to the
              mailing list, and sends a copy of your email to all the people on the
              list.  
              For example, evolution-hackers@ximian.com allows the
              <application>Evolution</application> programmers to converse
              publically about their latest developments so that everyone can
              stay up to date.
            </para>
            <para>
              There are two different types of mailing lists.  The first is a
              general submission list.  That means that anyone can write to the
              list.  The second is a managed list.  The managed lists have
              someone running them.  They can do as little as limit who
              subscribes to the list or as much as moderate which emails get on
              the list.

        <para>
          The post office forwards your mail for you when you change
          addresses, and you can forward a letter if it comes to you by mistake.
          The email <guilabel>Forward</guilabel> button
          works in much the same way.  It's particularly useful if you
          have received a message and you think someone else would
          like to see it.  You can forward a message as an attachment
          to a new message (this is the default) or
          you can send it <glossterm linkend="inline">inline</glossterm> as a quoted
          portion of the message you are sending.  Attachment
          forwarding is best if you want to send the full, unaltered
          message on to someone else.  Inline forwarding is best if
          you want to send portions of a message, or if you have a
          large number of comments on different sections of the
          message you are forwarding.  Remember to note from whom the
          message came, and where, if at all, you have removed or
          altered content.

          To forward a message you are reading, press

          <guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  If you
          prefer to forward the message <glossterm linkend="inline">inline</glossterm>
          instead of attached, select <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Forward
          Inline</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> from the menu.  Choose an
          addressee as you would when sending a new message; the
          subject will already be entered, but you can alter it.
          Enter your comments on the message in the

      <title>What is Encryption?</title>
      <para>
	Encryption is an ancient method of changing readable text to unreadable
	text that dates back to Egyptian times.  Encryption takes the statement
	"Evolution" and turns it into something which cannot be read without help
	through decryption.
	<example>
	  <title>Encryption Example</title>
	  <para>
	    Kevin sends his friend Rachel and email and chooses to encrypt it.
	    The email has the following contents:
	      Hi Rachel.
	      Go banana!
	      Kevin
	    He tells <application>Evolution</application> to encrypt the
	    message.  The computer encrypts the message which now looks like
	    @#$23ui7yr87#@!48970fsd.  When the information gets to Rachel,
	    she'll decrypt the message and it'll show up in plain text for her
	    to read.
	  </para>
	</example>
	Encryption can be used in email in two ways: to verify that the sender is
	the real sender, and to hide the message while in transmission.
	<application>Evolution</application> has the capability to do both.  
      </para>

    <sect2 id="encryption-keygen">
      <title>Generating your PGP key</title>
      <para>
	First, you need to create a PGP key.  To do this, you'll need GPG
	installed.
      </para>
      <tip>
	<title>GPG Versions</title>
	<para>
	  This manual covers version 1.0.6 of GPG.  If your version is different,
	  this may not be entirely accurate.  You may find out your version number
	  by typing in: <command>gpg --version</command>.
	</para>
      </tip>
      <para>
	You can start by typing in: <command>gpg --gen-key</command> at the
	console.  When you are asked about the algorythm to use, select 1.  The next question asks you about key length.
	The longer the key, more stronger it is.  However, the longer the key, the
	longer it takes to generate.  This is your choice.  However, 1024 bits
	(default) should be adequate.  The next question asks you if you want your
	key to expire.  Expiring keys make your key invalid after a certain amount
	of time, so old keys don't float around when they aren't used anymore.  This is the same concept
	as a coupon at a supermarket.  Next, you'll type in your real name, your
	email address, and a comment.  You should not forge this information, as
	it is used later to verify who you are.  Assuming that all your
	information is correct, press "O" to continue.  GPG now asks you for a
	passphrase.  This is a password which you will need to decrypt and encrypt
	messages.  This can be any length, with any characters in it.  It is case
	sensitive, which means that it does know the difference between capital
	letters and lower-case.  Now your key is generated.  It is recommend you
	surf the Internet, read your email, or write a letter in a word
	processor while your key is generated.
      </para>
      <para>
	Once this is completed, you'll be dropped back to the command line.
	Now you can view your key information by typing <command>gpg
	  --list-keys</command>.  You should see something similar to this:

	You'll now need to upload your public key to a keyserver, so that your
	friends can use your key.  You'll need to know the ID of your key, which
	is after the 1024D on the line beginning with pub.  For this example, it
	is 32j38dk2.  You now type in <command>gpg --send-keys --keyserver
	  wwwkeys.pgp.net 32j38dk2</command>.  Substitute your key ID for 32j38dk2.
	You will be prompted to type in your password <!-- verify that you need to

	  <title>Why Use a Keyserver?</title>
	  <para>
	    Keyservers store your public keys for you so that your friends can
	    decrypt your messages.  If you choose not to use a keyserver, you
	    can manually send your friends your public key.  It is much easier

	  <para>
	    GPG uses two types of keys: public and private.  The private should
	    be given out to no one, ever.  Your private key allows your mail to
	    be signed and encrypted and decrypted by anyone who has it.  The
	    public key is what you give your friends so that they can decrypt
