    <title> An Overview of the Evolution Mailer</title>
    <para>
       <application>Evolution</application> email is like other email
       programs in all the ways you would hope:
     <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It can sort and organize your mail in a wide variety of ways with
	   folders, searches, and filters.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	  It can send and receive mail in HTML or as plain text, and
	  supports file attachments.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It supports multiple mail sources, including <glossterm
	   linkend="imap">IMAP</glossterm>, <glossterm
	   linkend="pop">POP3</glossterm>, local
	   <systemitem><filename>mbox</filename></systemitem> and
	   <systemitem><filename>mh</filename></systemitem> files, and
	   even NNTP data (newsgroups), which isn't technically email.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      However, <application>Evolution</application> has some important
      differences.  First, it's built to handle very large amounts of
      mail without slowing down or crashing.  Both the <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link> functions
      were built for speed and efficiency on gargantuan mail
      volumes. There's also the <application>Evolution</application>
      <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">vFolder</link>, an
      advanced organizational feature not found in other mail clients.
      If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep every message you get
      in case you need to refer to it later, you'll find that feature
      especially useful.

    <title>Reading, Getting and Sending Mail</title>

      <title>Reading Mail</title>
      <para>
       You can start reading email by clicking
       <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> in the shortcut bar.  By
       default, the <interface>Inbox</interface> is open when you
       start <application>Evolution</application>, and the first
       time you see your Inbox, there's a message in it from Helix
       Code welcoming you to the application.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <application>Evolution</application>
	<guilabel>Inbox</guilabel>, should look like the one in <xref
	linkend="usage-mail-intro-fig">, which has a message from
	Helix Code. The message summary appears at the top, in the
	<interface>message list</interface>.  The message itself is
	displayed below that, in the <interface>view pane</interface>.
	If you find the <interface>view pane</interface> too small,
	you can double-click on the message in the <interface>message
	list</interface> to have it open in a new window.  Just like
	with folders, you can right-click on messages in the message
	list and get a menu of possible actions.

         Most of the mail-related actions you'll want to perform are
         listed in the <guimenu>Message</guimenu> menu in the menu
         bar.  The most frequently used ones, like
         <guimenuitem>Reply</guimenuitem> and
         <guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem>, also appear as buttons in
         the toolbar.

       <para>
         While you're there, have a look at the items items the bottom
         of the list, which are shortcuts for simple filter and
         vFolder creation.  You can learn more about filters and
         vFolders in <xref linkend="usage-mail-organize">; a

         is in <xref linkend="menuref">.

      <sect3 id="usage-mail-listorder">
	<title>Sorting the message list</title>
	<para>
          You can also select the order in which messages appear in
          that list.  To sort by sender, subject, or date, click on the
          bars with those labels at the top of the message list.  If
          you click twice, you'll sort them in reverse order.
        </para>
	<para>
          Aside from sorting the messages, you can opt to have the

          </menuchoice> to turn the threaded view on or off.  If the
          option selected, <application>Evolution</application> will
          attempt to associate related messages by using the
          <systemitem>References</systemitem>,
          <systemitem>In-Reply-To</systemitem>, and
          <systemitem>Subject</systemitem> message headers.  Messages
          which are related are then placed next to each other, so
          that it's easier to follow the thread of a conversation from
          message to message.

        <para>
          To delete a message, select it in the the <interface>message
          list</interface> by clicking on it once.  Then click on the
          <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button in the tool bar.  The

      <title>Checking Mail</title>
      <para>
	Now that you've had a look around the
	<interface>Inbox</interface>, it's time to check for new mail.
	Before you get it, though, you should decide where you want to
	keep it.  Your options will vary a little depending on your
	network setup, but they come down to storing the mail on your
	hard disk (using <glossterm linkend="pop">POP</glossterm>), or
	storing it on the network (using <glossterm
	linkend="imap">IMAP</glossterm>).  If you store your mail on
	your local hard disk, you can read it whether you're online or
	not, but you can only read it from one computer.  If you store
	it on the network, you can only read it when you're online,
	but you can access it from almost any computer with a network
	connection, even if it doesn't have
	<application>Evolution</application>.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you choose POP, you'll be putting mail in the
        <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Local</guilabel>
        folder.  If you choose IMAP, it's the
        <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> of a folder with the same name as
        your mail server.  That's so you can maintain several distinct
        IMAP servers if you want.  See <xref
        linkend="config-prefs-mail"> for more information about mail
        servers.
      </para>
      <para>
        Regardless of where you keep your mail, you can click
	<guibutton>Get mail</guibutton> in the toolbar to check your
	mail.  The first time you do that, the <interface>mail setup
	assistant</interface> will ask you for the information it
	needs to check your mail (see <xref
	linkend="config-setupassist"> for more information).  If
	you're checking mail over a network (instead of from local
	<systemitem><filename>mbox</filename></systemitem> files),
	you'll need to enter your email password.  Type it in, click
	<guibutton>OK</guibutton> and
	<application>Evolution</application> will download your mail.
	New mail will appear in your <interface>Inbox</interface>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you've entered your password,
        <application>Evolution</application> will hold it in memory so
        that you don't have to retype it every time you want to check
        mail.  It will only remember the password until you quit the
        application; each time you run
        <application>Evolution</application>, you need to re-enter
        your password.  If you'd like
        <application>Evolution</application> to forget your password
        sooner, select
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Forget
        Passwords</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, and it will do so
        immediately.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you get an error message instead of mail, you probably
	need to change your network settings.  To learn how to
	do that, have a look at <xref
	linkend="config-prefs-mail-network">, or ask your system
	administrator.

         <title>Using Evolution for News </title>
       <para>
         Newsgroups are so similar to email there's no reason not to
         read them side by side.  If you want to do that, add a news
         source to your configuration (see <xref
         linkend="config-prefs-network-news">). The news server will
         appear as a remote server, and will look exactly like an IMAP
         folder, except that you can't delete messages from it.  When
         you click <guibutton>Get Mail</guibutton>,
         <application>Evolution</application> will also check for news
         messages.  If you prefer to use a different program, there's

      <sect3 id="usage-mail-getnsend-get-attach">
	<title>Attachments, HTML Mail, and Live Documents</title>
	<para>
	  If someone sends you a file attached to an email (an
	  "attachment"), <application>Evolution</application> will
	  display the file at the bottom of the message to which it's
	  attached.  Text, HTML, and most images will be displayed in
	  the message itself.  For other files,
	  <application>Evolution</application> will provide a link and
	  icon at the end of the message.  Click on that, and
	  <application>Evolution</application> will ask you where you
	  want to put the file.  Once you've chosen a location and
	  saved the file, you can open, move, copy, or execute it just
	  like any other, using <application>Nautilus</application> or
	  your favorite shell or file manager.
	</para>

	<para>
	   <application>Evolution</application> can also display
	   HTML-formatted mail, complete with graphics.  HTML
	   formatting will display automatically, although you can
	   turn it off if you prefer.

        I once worked in the mail room of a large company, where my

        mail boxes and desks throughout the building.  Filters do that
        same job with email, but they lose much less mail than I did.
        In addition, you can have multiple filters performing multiple
        actions that may effect the same message in several ways.  For
        example, your filters could put copies of one message into
        multiple folders, or keep a copy and send one to another
        person as well.  Which is to say, it's quite a bit more
        flexible than an actual person with a pile of envelopes.

        need to refer to messages they have sent, find filters
        especially helpful to separate personal from list-related
        mail, but they're good for anybody who gets more than a few
        messages a day.  To create a filter, open the
        <interface>filter assistant</interface> by selecting
	<menuchoice>
	  <guimenu>Tools</guimenu> 
          <guimenuitem>Mail Filters</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>.

      <para>
        The <interface>filter assistant</interface> window contains a
        list of your current filters, sorted by the order in which
        they will be performed.  From the drop-down box at the top of
        the window, choose whether to display all your filters, only
        those filters which are performed on incoming mail, or only
        filters for outgoing mail.

      <para>
         The <interface>filter assistant</interface> also has a set of

        types of criteria, and you can have as many as you like; at

	    <listitem><para>
               If the part of the message examined contains the text you enter,

      <title>Getting Really Organized with Virtual Folders</title>
      <para>
	If filters aren't flexible enough for you, or you find
	yourself performing the same search again and again, consider
	a virtual folder. Virtual folders, or vFolders, are an
	advanced way of viewing your email messages within
	<application>Evolution</application>.  If you get a lot of
	mail or often forget where you put messages, vFolders can help
	you stay on top of things.
      </para>
      <para>
	A vFolder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational
	tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you
	set it up like a filter.  In other words, while a conventional
	folder actually contains messages, a vFolder is a view of
	messages that may be in several different folders.  The
	messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of
	criteria you choose in advance.
      </para>

      <para>
	As messages that meet the vFolder criteria arrive or are
	deleted, <application>Evolution</application> will
	automatically place them in and and remove them from the
	vFolder contents list.  When you delete a message, it gets
	erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as
	any vFolders which display it.
      </para>

      <para>
	Imagine a business trying to keep track of mail from hundreds
	of vendors and clients, or a university with overlapping and
	changing groups of faculty, staff, administrators and
	students.  The more mail you need to organize, the less you
	can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an
	organizational system that's not flexible enough.  vFolders
	make for better organization because they can accept
	overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing
	systems can't.
      </para>

      <example id="usage-mail-organize-vFolders-ex">
	<title>Using Folders, Searches, and vFolders</title>
	<para>
	   To organize my mail box, I set up a vFolder for emails from
	   my friend and co-worker Anna.  I have another one for
	   messages from anybody at work that have "Evolution" in the
	   subject line, so I can keep a record of what people from
	   work send me about <application>Evolution</application>.
	   If Anna sends a message about a picnic on Saturday, it only
	   shows up in the "Anna" folder. When Anna sends me mail
	   about the user interface for
	   <application>Evolution</application>, I can see that
	   message both in the "Anna" vFolder and in the "Internal
	   Evolution Discussion" vFolder.
	</para>
      </example>

	<!--  (INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE: vFolders in action) -->

      <para>
	 To create a vFolder, select <guimenuitem>vFolder
	 Editor</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
	 menu in the <interface>main window</interface>.  This
	 will bring up a dialog box that looks suspiciously like
	 the Filter Assistant (for more information on filters, see
	 <xref linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">), and which
	 presents you with a list of vFolders you have previously
	 created. If you have already created vFolders, you can
	 click on them in the frame labelled <guilabel>Select Rule
	 Type</guilabel>, and edit or remove them.  If you have
	 not created any, there will be only one available option:
	 click <guibutton>Add</guibutton> to add a new vFolder.
      </para>
      <para>
	 You can enter a name for your vFolder in the
	 <guilabel>Name</guilabel>.  Then, tell
	 <application>Evolution</application> what messages to look
	 for.  This process is exactly like filter creation: decide
	 between <guilabel>Match all parts</guilabel> and
	 <guilabel>Match any part</guilabel>, then choose what part of
	 the message to look in, what sort of matching to perform, and
	 specify exactly what text it is that you want to find.
       </para>
       <para>
         The second part, however, is slightly different.  In the
         section of the window labelled <guilabel>vFolder Sources
         </guilabel> is a list of folders in which
         <application>Evolution</application> will search for the
         contents of your vFolder.  Click <guibutton>Add</guibutton>
         to add a folder, or <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> to remove
         one.  That way, you can have your vFolder search in
         newsgroups, or just in one of your mailboxes, or just in a
         select few folders you've already screened with filters.
