  <abstract>
    <title> A Guide to the Evolution Mailer</title>
    <para>
       <application>Evolution</application> email is like other email
       programs in all the ways you would hope:
     <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It can sort and organize your mail in a wide variety of ways with
	   folders, searches, and filters.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	  It can send and receive mail in HTML or as plain text, and
	  permits multiple file attachments.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It supports multiple mail sources, including <glossterm
	   linkend="imap">IMAP</glossterm>, <glossterm
	   linkend="pop">POP3</glossterm>, local
	   <systemitem><filename>mbox</filename></systemitem> and
	   <systemitem><filename>mh</filename></systemitem> files, and
	   even NNTP messages (newsgroups), which aren't technically
	   email.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      However, <application>Evolution</application> has some important
      differences.  First, it's built to handle very large amounts of
      mail without slowing down or crashing.  Both the <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link> functions
      were built for speed and efficiency on gargantuan volumes of
      mail. There's also the <application>Evolution</application>
      <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">Virtual
      Folder</link>, an advanced organizational feature not found in
      many other mail clients.  If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep
      every message you get in case you need to refer to it later,
      you'll find this feature especially useful.

    <title>Reading, Getting and Sending Mail</title>

    <sect2 id="usage-mail-getnsend-read">
      <title>Reading Mail</title>
      <para>
       You can start reading email by clicking
       <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> in the shortcut bar. The first
       time you use <application>Evolution</application>, it will
       start with the <interface>Inbox</interface> open and show you a
       message from Ximian welcoming you to the application.
      </para>
      <para>
	Your <application>Evolution</application>
	<guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> will look something like the one in
	<xref linkend="usage-mail-intro-fig">. Just below the toolbar
	is the <interface>message list</interface>, showing message
	header information like <guilabel>Subject</guilabel> and
	<guilabel>Date</guilabel>.  The message itself appears below
	that, in the <interface>view pane</interface>.  If you find
	the <interface>view pane</interface> too small, you can resize
	the pane, enlarge the whole window, or double-click on the
	message in the <interface>message list</interface> to have it
	open in a new window.  To change the sizes of a pane, just click
        and hold on the divider between the two panes.  Then you can drag
        up and down to select the size of the panes.  Just like with 
        folders, you can
	right-click on messages in the message list and get a menu of
	possible actions.

      <para>
	Most of the mail-related actions you'll want to perform are
	listed in the <guimenu>Message</guimenu> menu in the menu
	bar.  The most frequently used ones, like
	<guimenuitem>Reply</guimenuitem> and
	<guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem>, also appear as buttons in
         the toolbar, and almost all of them are duplicated in the
	right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts, which tend to be
	faster once you get the hang of them.  You can choose
	whichever way you like best; the idea is that the software
	should work the way you want, rather than making you work the
	way the it does.

	<title>Sorting the message list</title>
	<para>
          One of the ways <application>Evolution</application> lets
          you choose the way you work is the way it lets you sort your
          message lists.  To sort by sender, subject, or date, click
          on the bars with those labels at the top of the message
          list. The direction of the arrow next to the label indicates
          the direction of the sort, and if you click again, you'll
          sort them in reverse order. For example, click once on
          <guilabel>Date</guilabel> to sort messages by date from
          oldest to newest.  Click again, and
          <application>Evolution</application> sorts the list from
          newest to oldest. You can also right-click on the message
          header bars to get a set of sorting options, and add or
          remove columns from the message list.  You can find detailed
          instructions on how to customize your message display
          columns in <xref linkend="usage-mail-organize-columns">.
        </para>
	<para>
          You can also choose a threaded message view. Select
          <menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Threaded</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> to turn
          the threaded view on or off.  When you select this option,
          <application>Evolution</application> groups the replies to a
          message with the original, so you can follow the thread of a
          conversation from one message to the next.

          Then click on the <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button in

      <title>Staying organized: Mail Filters in Evolution</title>
      <para>
	Filters work very much like the mail room in a large company.
	Their purpose is to bundle, sort, and distribute mail to the
	various folders.  
        In addition, you can have multiple filters performing multiple
        actions that may effect the same message in several ways.  For
        example, your filters could put copies of one message into
        multiple folders, or keep a copy and send one to another
        person as well, and it can do that in under a second. Which is
        to say, it's faster and more flexible than an actual person
        with a pile of envelopes.
      </para>
      <para>
        Most often, you'll want to have
        <application>Evolution</application> put mail into different
        folders, but you can have it do almost anything you like.
        People who get lots of mail, or who often need to refer to old
        messages, find filters especially helpful, but they can greatly benefit
        anybody who gets more than a few messages a day.  To
        create a filter, open the <interface>filter
        assistant</interface> by selecting
	<menuchoice>
	  <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> 
          <guimenuitem>Mail Filters</guimenuitem>

      <para>
        The <interface>filter assistant</interface> window contains a

        filters for incoming mail, and <guilabel>Outgoing</guilabel>
        for those which sort only outgoing mail.
      </para>
      <para>
         The <interface>filter assistant</interface> also has a set of

        If you don't have any filters set up, the only one of those
        buttons you can click is <guibutton>Add</guibutton>, which
        will open a dialog to let you add a filter rule.  If you do

      <title>Getting Really Organized with Virtual Folders</title>
      <para>
	If filters aren't flexible enough for you, or you find
	yourself performing the same search again and again, consider
	a virtual folder. Virtual folders, or vFolders, are an
	advanced way of viewing your email messages within
	<application>Evolution</application>.  If you get a lot of
	mail or often forget where you put messages, virtual folders can help
	you stay on top of things.
      </para>
      <para>
	A virtual folder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational
	tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you
	set it up like a filter.  In other words, while a conventional
	folder actually contains messages, a virtual folder is a view of
	messages that may be in several different folders.  The
	messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of
	criteria you choose in advance.

	As messages that meet the virtual folder criteria arrive or are
	deleted, <application>Evolution</application> will
	automatically place them in and remove them from the
	virtual folder contents list.  When you delete a message, it gets
	erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as
	any virtual folders which display it.
      </para>

      <para>
	Imagine a business trying to keep track of mail from hundreds
	of vendors and clients, or a university with overlapping and
	changing groups of faculty, staff, administrators and
	students.  The more mail you need to organize, the less you
	can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an
	organizational system that's not flexible enough.  Virtual folders
	make for better organization because they can accept
	overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing
	systems can't.

	<title>Using Folders, Searches, and Virtual Folders</title>
	<para>
	   To organize my mail box, I set up a virtual folder for
	   emails from my friend and co-worker Anna.  I have another
	   one for messages that have "ximian.com" in the address and
	   "Evolution" in the subject line, so I can keep a record of
	   what people from work send me about
	   <application>Evolution</application>.  If Anna sends me a
	   message about anything other than Evolution, it only shows
	   up in the "Anna" folder. When Anna sends me mail about the
	   user interface for <application>Evolution</application>, I
	   can see that message both in the "Anna" virtual folder and
	   in the "Internal Evolution Discussion" virtual folder.
	</para>
      </example>

	<!--  (INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE: virtual folders in action) -->

      <para>
	 To create a virtual folder, select <menuchoice>
	 <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Virtual Folder
	 Editor</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  This will bring up a
	 dialog box that looks suspiciously like the filter window
	 (for more information on filters, see <xref
	 linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">), and which
	 presents you with a list of virtual folders you have previously
	 created. If you have created any virtual folders, they are listed
	 here, and you can select, edit or remove them if you wish.
	 If you have not created any, there will be only one available
	 option: click <guibutton>Add</guibutton> to add a new
	 Virtual Folder.
      </para>
      <para>
	 You can enter a name for your virtual folder in the
	 <guilabel>Name</guilabel>.  Then, tell
	 <application>Evolution</application> what messages to look
	 for.  This process is exactly like filter creation: decide
	 between <guilabel>Match all parts</guilabel> and
	 <guilabel>Match any part</guilabel>, then choose what part of
	 the message to look in, what sort of matching to perform, and
	 specify exactly what it is that you want to find, be it a
	 line of text, a score, a regular expression, or a particular date or
	 range of dates.
       </para>
       <para>
         The second part, however, is slightly different.  In the
         section of the window labelled <guilabel>Virtual Folder Sources
         </guilabel> is a list of folders in which
         <application>Evolution</application> will search for the
         contents of your vFolder.  Click <guibutton>Add</guibutton>
         to add a folder, or <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> to remove
         one.  That way, you can have your vFolder search in
         newsgroups, or just in one of your mailboxes, or just in a
         select few folders you've already screened with filters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The vFolder creation window is shown in <xref

      <para>
         <application>Evolution</application> lets you handle your
         IMAP and newsgroup subscriptions with the same tool: the
         subscriptions manager.  To start using it, choose
         <menuchoice> <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Manage
         Subscriptions</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.
      </para>
      <para>
         If you have configured any IMAP (mail) or NNTP (news)
         servers, you will see them listed in the left half of the
         subscription management window.  Click on a server to select
         it, and you will see the folders or newsgroups available to
         you.  You can then select individual folders and subscribe to
         them, or remove yourself from the subscription list.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you have subscribed to a folder or newsgroup, your system
        will check for new messages whenever you press the
        <guibutton>Get Mail</guibutton> button.
