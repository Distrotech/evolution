      Evolution is still beta software, so the bug tracking is best
      left to the bugzilla system and to the programmers.  However,
      there are a number of limitations that will not be addressed
      before version 1.0. The most notable are: Import of Microsoft
      Outlook .pst files, and compatibility with the Microsoft
      Exchange protocol.
