	Here is how both the Evolution implementation and IDL namespacing
is to be organized, NB. for implementations and oafinfo filenames we replace
'/' with '_'

Files:

/GNOME/Evolution/

	Addressbook/
	Calendar/
		Control
		gnomecal
	Composer/
	Mail/
	Notes/		
	Shell/
	Summary/
		test
		rdf
	Wombat/

Components:

	Shell components end in _ShellComponent, controls in _Control,
executive summary components in _ExecutiveSummaryComponent and
factories append 'Factory'.
