    <title>How the Wombat generates alarm instances</title>

    <para>
      This chapter describes the algorithm that the &Wombat; uses
      internally to generate instances of a calendar component's
      alarms.  You do not need to read this chapter if you are simply
      using the client-side functions.

      <title>What makes up an alarm trigger</title>

      <para>
	VTODO and VEVENT calendar components can have any number of
	alarms defined for them.  Each alarm has a trigger
	specification, an alarm type (display, audio, email, or
	procedure), and data corresponding to the alarm type.  The
	Wombat side of things is interested only in the trigger
	specification, since this is all that the Wombat needs to
	produce alarm instances.
      </para>

      <para>
	An alarm trigger can be relative or absolute.  Relative
	triggers occur a certain time before or after the start or end
	of a calendar component's occurrence.  For example, you could
	configure a trigger to notify you 15 minutes before an
	appointment starts, so that you can get to its location on
	time; or another one to notify you 5 minutes after another
	person's meeting has ended, so that you can call that person
	on the phone after the meeting and not disturb him while
	there.  Absolute triggers occur at a specific point in time;
	you can configure an alarm to trigger exactly at a particular
	date and time that has no relation to the component's
	occurrences at all.
