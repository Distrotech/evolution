    <title>Developing Applications with the &Evolution; Calendar</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>
	This part of the &Evolution; Developer's Guide describes how
	to write applications for the &Evolution; Calendar by using
	its public interfaces.  The &Evolution; Calendar exports its
	functionality through a number of interfaces, including CORBA,
	GTK+ wrappers for Bonobo objects, and other utility libraries.
	This part also describes the internals of the calendar so that
	it will be easy for you to make changes to &Evolution;'s core
	code.
      </para>

      <para>
	You should read this part of the &Evolution; Developer's guide
	if you intend to write client applications that use the
	functionality of the &Evolution; Calendar, such as its storage
	interfaces and generic recurrence engine.  If you intend to
	make changes to the calendar's core code, it will be useful to
	read the sections on the calendar internals as well.  Even if
	you do not intend to modify the core code of the calendar, it
	may be useful to know a few things about the way it works so
	that you can make better use of the public interfaces.
