	not referenc.sgml here.

	* calendar/architecture.sgml: Finished the calendar architecture
	chapter.

2000-11-29  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* evolution-devel-guide.sgml: Added an id for the API reference <part>.
	Added the FDL <legalnotice>.
	Added the preface and toplevel reference entities.
	Added entities for Evolution, Wombat, and Camel.
	Added an appendix for the GNU FDL.
	
	* preface.sgml: New file with the introduction to the Evolution
	Developer's Guide.

	* reference.sgml: Split the toplevel reference part into its own
	file.

	* fdl.sgml: Added the GNU Free Documentation License.

	* calendar/evolution-calendar.sgml: Added an id for the <part>.

	* calendar/public-reference.sgml: Added an id for the <reference>.
	Moved this file over from calendar/reference.sgml.

	* Makefile.am (local_entities): Added a list of the SGML files
	that define entities for inclusion in the toplevel document.  This
	way we can track documentation file dependencies down to all
	levels.
	(html/index.html): Made the toplevel document depend on
	$(local_entities).  Also, removed the "html" target and put its
	contents directly here; this way we avoid having .PHONY targets.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Removed the evolution_devel_guideDATA; it made no
	sense.
	(content_files): Added preface.sgml and reference.sgml.

2000-08-09  Peter Williams  <peterw@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (maintainer-clean-local): Don't depend
