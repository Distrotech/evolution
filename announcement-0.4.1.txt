* Changes since version 0.3

	Shell:

	  - Added interfaces to display messages and a progress bar when the
	    component is busy.  (Ettore)

	  - Changed the shell BonoboUIHandler code to allow placing menu items
	    such as "Print" in the right places.  (Ettore)

	  - Added code to check if an existing `~/evolution' directory
	    actually has the content we expect and, if not, complain to the
	    user.  (Dan)

	  - Fixed some Bonobo-related refcounting problems.  (Michael Meeks)

	  - Removed the GConf dependency.  (JP)

	  - Improved the API for the folder selection dialog.  (Ettore)

	  - Memory leak fixes.  (Peter)

	Calendar:

	  The calendar is in the middle of major rewrite. Evolution 0.4.1
	  ships with essentially the same calendar component as 0.3 did.

	Addressbook:

	  - More work on the Palm Pilot conduits.  (Chris Toshok)

	  - Fixed some LDAP-related crashes.  (Chris Toshok)

	  - Added support for displaying embedded vCards through a Bonobo
	    component.  (Chris Lahey)

	  - Added support for generic fields.  (Chris Lahey)

	  - Fixed the navigation order for the Tab key in the contact editor
	    window.  (Chris Lahey)

	  - Fixed some Bonobo-related bugs and crashes.  (Chris Lahey, Michael
	    Meeks)

	  - Only display entries that have an email address in the address
	    selector dialog.  (Chris Lahey)

	  - Added an utility program to import vCards from Gnomecard.  (Chris
	    Lahey)

	Mailer:

	 Generic

	  - Long mailer operations (such as fetching new mail) now run
	    asynchronously rather than blocking the UI. This involved
	    a major rewrite of much of the Camel and mailer code.  (Peter)

	  - GPG/PGP message decryption support (Nathan Thompson-Amato, Dan)

	  - Unfinished messages in the composer can be saved to the "Drafts"
	    folder and finished later.  (Jeff)

	  - Double-clicking on a message in the message view now opens it in a
	    separate window.  (Jeff)

	  - vCards attached to messages now bring up a minicard view with a
	    button to add the vCard to the addressbook (Chris Lahey, Dan)

	  - Inline uuencoded/binhexed "attachment" support (Dan)

	  - "Mark All Messages Seen" command.  (Cody Russell)

	 Filters / VFolders

	  - Major filter/vfolder dialog rewrite (Michael Zucchi) VFolders can
	    now search any (searchable) folder, not just Inbox.

	  - Auto-filter/auto-vfolder code (right click on a message in the
	    list and pick one of the options at the bottom of the menu to
	    create a filter/vfolder rule for similar messages).  (Michael)

	  - You can now set the color of messages in the message list, based
	    on filter rules.  (Local stores can also now store arbitrary user
	    flags, although there is not yet UI code to set/view them.)
	    (Michael)

	  - Added "Save" button to the quicksearch bar to save a search as a
	    vfolder.  (Michael)

	 Configuration

	  - Major mail config dialog rewrite (JP).

	  - The mailer now remembers your threaded/unthreaded message view
	    setting between sessions.  (Jeremy Wise).

	  - Support for multiple identities (JP, Jeff), sources (JP, Peter), and
	    IMAP servers (JP, Dan)

	 Providers

	  - You can now leave POP mail on the server. (This will [currently]
	    only work right with POP servers that support the UIDL command.
	    On other servers, it will never download some messages unless you
	    never delete mail.)

	  - There is now an MH-like local store available, and code to convert
	    a folder from one type to the other.  (Michael)

	  - The mbox provider now writes out "From " lines that are more
	    compatible with other mailers (like Mutt) that are picky about
	    their exact format.  (Michael)

	  - The IMAP provider now supports searching (Jeff). Also various
	    other speed/efficiency/robustness improvements (Jeff), and support
	    for old IMAP4 servers as well as IMAP4rev1 (Jon K Hellan).

Please note that this is still software in development and should not
be used for production work.  We appreciate testers and contributors,
but please remember that Evolution will still be buggy, incomplete,
and temperamental.

Thanks to the many people who have sent in suggestions and fixes.

(And of course, this announcement was sent with Evolution. :-))

Enjoy,
  The Evolution team.
