 * Copied from gnome-i18nP.h, because this header is typically not installed
 *
 * This file has to be included before any file from the GNOME libraries
 * to have this override the definitions that are pulled from the gnome-i18n.h
 *
 * the difference is that gnome-i18n.h is used for applications, and this is
 * used by libraries (because libraries have to use dcgettext instead of
 * gettext and they need to provide the translation domain, unlike apps).
 *
 * So you can just put this after you include config.h
